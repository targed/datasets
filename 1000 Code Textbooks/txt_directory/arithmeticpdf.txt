Preface 
 
Arithmetic is the basic topic of mathematics. According to the American Heritage 
Dictionary  [1], it concerns “The mathematics of  integers under addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, involution, and evolution.” 
The present text differs from other treatments of arithmetic in several respects: 
The provision of simple but precise defin itions of the counting numbers and other 
notions introduced. 
The use of simple but precise notation that is executable on a computer, allowing 
experimentation and providing a simple a nd meaningful introduction to computer 
programming. 
The introduction and significant use of fundamental mathematical notions (such as 
vectors, matrices, Heaviside operators, a nd duality) in simple contexts that make 
them easy to understand. This lays a firm foundation for a wealth of later use in mathematics. 
Emphasis is placed on the use of guesses by speculation and criticism in the spirit of 
Lakatos, as discussed in the treatment of proofs in Chapter 5. 
The thrust of the book might best be appreci ated by comparing it with Felix Klein’s 
Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint  [2]. However, I shun the 
corresponding title Arithmetic from an Advanced Standpoint  because it would incorrectly 
suggest that the treatment is intended only for mature mathematicians; on the contrary, 
the use of simple, executable notation makes it accessible to any serious student possessing little more than a knowledge of the counting numbers. 
Like Klein, I do not digress to discuss the impor tance of the topics treated, but leave that 
matter to the knowledge of the mature r eader and to the faith of the neophyte.

Introduction 
A. Counting Numbers 
The list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  shows the first dozen counting numbers , and 
any reader of this book could extend the list to tedious lengths. A lthough this definition 
by example captures the basic idea, it fails  to address related questions such as: 
1. Do counting numbers continue forever? 2. Are there other numbers that precede the first counting number? 3.  Are there other numbers between  the counting numbers or elsewhere? 
These questions were addressed a century ago by Peano, who began by introducing the 
notion of a successor “operation” which, when  applied to any counting number, produced 
its successor. For example, 
successor 3  would produce 4.  
We will denote the successor operation by the two-character word >:  . For example: 
 
 >: 3 4   >: 999 1000 
 
The foregoing is an example of dialogue w ith the computer. Because the notation used 
here (and throughout the book) can be execu ted by a computer provided with the 
language J (available from website jsoftware.com ), every expression used can be tested 
by executing it, as can related expressions that the reader may wish to experiment with. For example, one might apply the successor to lists of counting numbers as follows: 
 
   >: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13     >: 2 4 6 8 10 3 5 7 9 11  
2  Arithmetic 
  
Is there a last or largest  counting number? Peano answered this by asserting that every 
counting number has a distinct successor, thus introducing the idea of an unbounded or infinite list of counting numbers. 
B. Integers 
Since 7 is the successor of 6, we may also say that 6 is the predecessor  of 7, and 
introduce a predecessor operation denoted by <:  . For example: 
 
   <:3 5 7 9 11 2 4 6 8 10     >:2 4 6 8 10 3 5 7 9 11 
It would be convenient if the pr edecessor (like the successor) applied to all counting 
numbers, but since 1 is the first counting number, its predecessor cannot be a counting 
number. We therefore introduce a wider class of numbers, in which every member has a 
predecessor as well as a successor. Thus: 
 
   <: 1 0    <: 0 _1    <: _1 _2  
This wider class of numbers is called the integers , and includes zero (0), as well as 
negative numbers (_1 _2 _3  etc.). 
It is helpful to form the habit of looking up any new technical term in a good dictionary; 
even if the term is already familiar, its etymology often provides useful insight. For example, in the American Heritage Dictionary  (a dictionary to be recommended because 
of its method of treating etymology) the definition of integer  refers to the Indo-European 
root tag that means “to touch; handle”. This with the prefix in- (meaning not) implies that 
an integer is untouched, or whole; in contrast  to one that is “fractured”, like one of the 
fractions one-half, one-quarter, etc. 
Similarly, the word infinite  introduced in Section A will be found to mean not (in) finite, 
or without finish. 
C. Inverses 
The predecessor operation ( <:) is said to be the inverse  of the successor ( >:) because it 
“undoes” its work. For example, <:>: 8  yields 8, and the same relation holds for any 
integer. Thus: 
 
   >:1 2 3 4 5 6 <:>:1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6  
In the original definition the successor applie d only to the counting numbers. We now re-
define it to apply to all integers by defining it as the inverse of predecessor. For example:  
Chapter 1  Introduction   3 
  
 
   >:<: _3 _2 _1 0 1 2 _3 _2 _1 0 1 2 
D. Domains 
The successor >: defined in Section A applied only to counting numbers, and they would 
be said to be its domain  (over which it “ruled”). In defining the predecessor in Section B 
it became necessary to extend its domain to the integers , that also included zero and the 
negative numbers. By re-defining the successor as the inverse of the predecessor, we also 
extended its domain to the integers. 
We will find that the introduction of furt her operations (such as the inverse of 
“doubling”) will require further extensions  of domains. However, to keep the 
development simple, we will restrict attention to simple domains as far as possible. 
E. Nouns and Verbs 
The successor operation >: can be said to “act upon” a counting number to produce a 
result, and is therefore analogous to an “action word” or verb in English. Similarly, the 
numbers to which the verb >: applies are analogous to nouns in English. 
We will soon see that the terms verb and noun  lead to further important analogies with 
adverbs, conjunctions, and other parts of sp eech in English. We will therefore adopt 
them, even though other terms ( function , operator , and variable ) are more commonly 
used in mathematics. However, function  will sometimes be used as a  synonym for verb. 
F. Pronouns and Proverbs  
Consider the following use of the pronoun it : 
 
   it=: 1 2 3 4 5 6    <: it 0 1 2 3 4 5     >:<: it 1 2 3 4 5 6  
The copula =: behaves like the copulas is and are in English, and the first sentence 
would be read aloud as “ it is the list of counting numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 ” or as “it is 1 
2 3 4 5 6 ”. 
In English the names used for pronouns ar e restricted to a very few, such as it, he, and 
she; they are not so restricted here. For example: 
 
   zero=: 0       neg=: _1 _2 _3    list6=: it    list6,zero,neg 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 _1 _2 _3  
4  Arithmetic 
  
A proverb is used to stand for a verb, just as a pronoun is used to stand for a noun. (The 
word proverb  in this sense is found only in larger dictionaries.) For example: 
 
   increment=: >: decrement=: <:    increment list6,zero,neg 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 0 _1 _2     inc=: increment    inc list6 2 3 4 5 6 7 
G. Conjunctions 
The phrase Run and hide expresses an action performed as a sequence of two simpler 
actions, and in it the word and is said to be a copulative conjunction . We will use the 
symbol @ to denote an analogous conjunction. For example: 
 
   add3=: >: @ >: @ >:    add3 1 2 3 4 5 6 4 5 6 7 8 9     identity=: <: @ >:    identity 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6  
Although the verb identity  defined above makes no change to its argument, it is an 
important verb, so important that it is given its own symbol. Thus: 
 
   ] 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6  
Although a verb for the twelfth successor could be expressed by repeated use of @, it 
would be tedious, and we introduce a second conjunction illustrated below: 
 
   list=: 1 2 3 4 5 6    >:^:3 list 4 5 6 7 8 9     >:^:12 list 13 14 15 16 17 18     <:^:6 list _5 _4 _3 _2 _1 0  
The conjunction ^: is called the power  conjunction; it applies its left argument (the verb 
to its left) the number of times specified by its noun right argument. 
Chapter 1  Introduction   5 
  
H. Addition And Subtraction  
The examples of the preceding section illustrate the fact that if n is any counting number, 
then the verb >:^:n  adds  n  to its argument, and <:^:n  subtracts n. 
For example : 
   n=: 5 
   abc=: 10 11 12 13 14 15    >:^:n abc 15 16 17 18 19 20     <:^:n abc 5 6 7 8 9 10     abc+n abc-n 15 16 17 18 19 20 5 6 7 8 9 10  
The last two examples introduce the notation commonly used for addition and 
subtraction, and the whole set of exampl es essentially defines them in terms of the 
simpler successor and predecessor of Peano. 
I. Verb Tables 
Two lists can be added and s ubtracted as illustrated below:  
 
   a=: 0 1 2 3 4 5    b=: 2 3 5 7 11 13    a+b a-b 2 4 7 10 15 18 _2 _2 _3 _4 _7 _8     a+a 0 2 4 6 8 10    a-a 0 0 0 0 0 0     a +/ b 2 3  5  7 11 13 3 4  6  8 12 14 4 5  7  9 13 15 5 6  8 10 14 16 6 7  9 11 15 17 7 8 10 12 16 18     a +/ a 0 1 2 3 4  5 1 2 3 4 5  6 2 3 4 5 6  7 3 4 5 6 7  8 4 5 6 7 8  9 5 6 7 8 9 10 
6  Arithmetic 
  
The last two examples show addition tables  that add each  item of the first argument to 
each  item of the second in a systematic manner. The verb +/ is formed by applying the 
adverb  / to the verb + , and is usually referred to as the verb “plus table”. The adverb / 
applies uniformly to other verbs, and we can therefore produce subtraction tables as 
follows: 
 
  a-/a b-/1 2 
0 _1 _2 _3 _4 _5  1  0 1  0 _1 _2 _3 _4  2  1 2  1  0 _1 _2 _3  4  3 3  2  1  0 _1 _2  6  5 4  3  2  1  0 _1 10  9 5  4  3  2  1  0 12 11 
 
To make clear the meaning of a verb table, draw a vertical line to its left and write the left 
argument vertically to the left of it; draw a horizontal line above the table, and enter the 
right argument horizontally above it. We can produce such an annotated display of a verb table by using the adverb 
table  instead of /, as follows: 
 
   a +table b 
+-+---------------+ 
| |2 3  5  7 11 13| +-+---------------+ |0|2 3  5  7 11 13| |1|3 4  6  8 12 14| |2|4 5  7  9 13 15| |3|5 6  8 10 14 16| |4|6 7  9 11 15 17| |5|7 8 10 12 16 18| +-+---------------+     a-table a +-+----------------+ | |0  1  2  3  4  5| +-+----------------+ |0|0 _1 _2 _3 _4 _5| |1|1  0 _1 _2 _3 _4| |2|2  1  0 _1 _2 _3| |3|3  2  1  0 _1 _2| |4|4  3  2  1  0 _1| |5|5  4  3  2  1  0| +-+----------------+  
J. Relations 
Any two integers a and b are related in certain simple ways: a precedes  (or is less than ) 
b; a equals b; or a follows  (or is greater than ) b. We introduce the verbs < and = and > 
whose results show whether the particular  relation holds between the arguments. For 
example: 
 
   1<3 1=3 1>3 
1 0  0 
 
   a=: 1 2 3 4 5 
   b=: 6-a    b 
Chapter 1  Introduction   7 
  
5 4 3 2 1 
 
   a<b 
1 1 0 0 0 
 
   a=b a>b 
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 
 
   a</b 
1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
 
   a=/b a>/b 
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 
A result of 1 indicates that the relation holds, and 0 indicates that it does not; it is 
reasonable to read the ones and zeros  aloud as “true” and “false”. The final example is a 
greater-than table. 
K. Lesser-Of and Greater-Of  
The lesser  of (or minimum  of) two arguments is the one that precedes (or perhaps equals) 
the other; the verb <. yields the lesser of its arguments. For example:  
 
   a b 
1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 
 
   a<.b a>.b 
1 2 3 2 1 5 4 3 4 5  
 
   a<./b 
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 3 3 3 2 1 4 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 
L. List And Table Formation  
Although any list can be specified by listing its members, certain lists can be specified 
more conveniently. The integers  verb i. produces lists or tables of integers (beginning 
with zero) that are convenient in producing verb tables. For example : 
 
 ] a=:i. 5 
0 1 2 3 4     a<./a 
8  Arithmetic 
  
0 0 0 0 0 
0 1 1 1 1 0 1 2 2 2 0 1 2 3 3 0 1 2 3 4 
 
   4-a 
4 3 2 1 0 
 
   1+a 
1 2 3 4 5    i. _5 4 3 2 1 0    i.3 4 0 1  2  3 4 5  6  7 8 9 10 11 
 
The verb # replicates  its right argument the number of times specified by the left:  
 
   3#5 
5 5 5 
 
   5#3 
3 3 3 3 3 
 
   2 3 4 # 6 7 8 
6 6 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 
 
   b=: _2 + i. 5 
   b _2 _1 0 1 2     c=:b>0    c 0 0 0 1 1    c#b 1 2  
The verb $ “shapes” its right argument, using cyclic repetition of its items as needed: 
    8$2 3 5 3 4$2 3 5 2 3 5 2 3 5 2 3 2 3 5 2   3 5 2 3   5 2 3 5 
M. Punctuation 
Although the two sentences: 
 The teacher said he was stupid 
 The teacher, said he, was stupid 
Chapter 1  Introduction   9 
  
differ only in punctuation, they differ greatly in meaning. 
Arithmetic sentences may also be punctuated (b y paired parentheses) as illustrated below: 
 
   (8-3)+4 9    8-(3+4) 1    8-3+4 1  
The last sentence illustrates the behaviour in  the absence of parentheses: in effect, the 
sentence is evaluated from right to left or, e quivalently, the right argument of each verb is 
the value of the entire phrase to its right. 
Punctuation makes possible many useful expressions. For example: 
 
   c=: 2 7 1 8 2 8    (c=2)#c 2 2     ((c=2)>.(c=8))#c 2 8 2 8     (c<2)>.(c=2) 1 0 1 0 1 0  
The last sentence can be read as “ c is less than or equal to 2”. It is equivalent to the verb  
<: in the expression c<:2 . 
The beginner is advised to use fully-paren thesized sentences even though some of the 
parentheses are redundant. Thus, write (c<2)>.(c=2)  even though (c<2)>.c=2  is 
equivalent. 
N. Insertion 
   a=: 2 7 1 8 2  
   2+7+1+8+2 20    +/a 20  
The foregoing sentences illustrate the fact that the adverb / produces a verb that “inserts” 
its verb left argument between the items of the argument of the resulting verb +/ . Insert 
applies equally to other verbs. For example:   
 
   >./a 2>.7>.1>.8>.2 8 8     sum=:+/     max=:>./ 
10  Arithmetic 
  
 
   min=:<./     sum a 20     spread=: (max a)-(min a)     range=: (min a)+i. >:spread    range 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
O. Multiplication 
   m=:3 
   n=:5    n#m 3 3 3 3 3     +/n#m 15  
The final result above is clearly the product  of m and n, and the sentences essentially 
define multiplication in terms of repeated a ddition. In mathematics the product verb is 
denoted in a variety of ways; we will use * as in: 
 
   m*n 15     dig=: 1+i. 6 odds=: 1+2*i. k=: 6    dig odds 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 3 5 7 9 11     */dig +/odds 720 36    !#dig  k*k 720 36  
The last two sentences on the left illustrate the definition of a new verb,  factorial , 
denoted by ! . 
P. Power 
   m=: 3 n=: 5 
   n#m      */n#m 3 3 3 3 3 243  
The final result above is called the nth power of m, or m to the power n. Comparison with 
Section O will show that power is defined in terms of multiplication in the same way that 
multiplication is defined in terms of addition. 
Chapter 1  Introduction   11 
  
In most math texts there is no symbol for power, it being denoted by showing the second 
argument as a superscript. We will adopt the symbol ^ used by de Morgan [3] about a 
century ago. For example:  
 
   m^n  3^5 243 243 
 
   (3^5)*(3^2) 3^(5+2) 2187 2187 
As suggested by the equivalence of the last two sentences, (a^b)*(a^c)  is equivalent to 
a^(b+c) . The reason for this can be seen by substituting the definition of power given 
above:       
 
   (3^5)*(3^2) (*/5#3)*(*/2#3) 2187 2187     (5+2)#3 */(5+2)#3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2187 
Q. Summary 
The main results of this chap ter may be summarized as follows: 
1. The idea of the counting numbers is formalized and extended to infinity by 
introducing the notion that every counting number has a successor ; it is extended 
to include zero and negative numbers  by introducing the notion of predecessor , 
inverse to successor . 
2. Symbols are introduced to denote successor and predecessor ( >: and <:); 
because they specify actions  they are called verbs , and the integers they act upon 
are called nouns . 
3. The copula =: is introduced to assign a name (called a pronoun) to a noun or list 
of nouns and to assign a name (called a proverb) to a verb. 
4. Conjunctions ( @ and ^:) are introduced to define verbs that are specified by a 
sequence of simpler verbs. 
5. Addition is defined in terms of a seque nce of successors; subtraction is defined in 
terms of predecessors. 
6. Verb tables are introduced to display th e behaviour of addition, subtraction, and 
other verbs that apply to two arguments, such as relations ( < = > ) and minimum 
and maximum ( <. >. ). 
7. Parentheses are introduced as punctuation, that is, to specify the order in which 
phrases in a sentence are to be interpreted. 
8    An adverb called insert  (denoted by /) is introduced to insert a verb between 
items of a list argument, and +/ is used with replication  (#) to define 
multiplication in terms of repeated addition; power is defined in terms of 
repeated multiplication. 
We will now summarize all of the notation used. This summary may be useful for 
reference, but because related symbols are used  for related ideas, it should also be studied 
12  Arithmetic 
  
for mnemonic aids. Succeeding chapters conclude with similar summaries of notation, 
and all notation is available from the J Dictionary discussed in Book 1. 
The table shows the verbs in three columns, each headed by the final character (dot or

The thoughtful reader may have noticed such u sage in this chapter: the verbs produced by 
the adverb / (as shown above), and the <: used for predecessor  throughout, but used 
dyadically (that is, with two arguments) for Less or equal  in Section M. This ambivalent 
use of verbs is discussed fully in Chapter 2. 
R. On Language 
Notation , the term normally used to refer to the mode of expression in math, is defined 
(in the AHD ) as “A system of figures or symbols used in specialized fields ... ”. An 
Chapter 1  Introduction   13 
  
executable notation such as that used here is normally called a programming language ; 
we will use the terms notation  and language  interchangeably.  
Programming languages are commonly taught in specific courses, prerequisite to courses 
in topics that employ them. In mathematics, on the contrary, notation is not taught as such, but is introduced in passing as require d by the subject. The same approach is 
adopted in this text. 
Any reader interested in using the notation in topics other than those treated here should 
consult Section 9 L. 
In a math course there is little reason for a student to be curious or concerned about 
notation that has not yet been used. In us ing a programming language the situation is 
somewhat different; a student who already knows something of the possibilities of computer programming may feel frustrated at not knowing what symbols to use for operations that she knows must be available in the language. 
There are several avenues open to the stude nt who may be more interested in the 
language than in the treatment of arithmetic: 
1. Press key F1 in the top row to display th e vocabulary of J. Then click the mouse 
on any desired entry in the vocabulary to  display its definition. Press Esc to 
remove the display. 
2. Use the computer to experiment with various facilities, and therefore to explore 
their definitions. 
3. Range ahead to the On Language  sections that conclude Chapters 2 and 9. 
 
Exercises 
In exercises first write (or at least sketch out) the result of each sentence without using 
the computer; then enter the sentence on the computer to check your answer. 
In using the computer, it will be more efficient if you familiarize yourself with the 
available editing facilities. In particular, these allow you to revise entries being prepared, 
and to recall earlier entries for re-entry. Also learn to use expressions such as: 
   names 0 To display the names used for pronouns  
 
   names 1 To display the names used for adverbs 
    names 2 
To display the names used for conjunctions 
    names 3

 Properties of Verbs 
A. Valence, Ambivalence, And Bonds 
In the phrases a-b and a<:b  and a+/b  the verbs “bond to” two arguments and (adopting 
an analogous term from chemistry) we say that in this context the verbs have valence 2 ; 
in the expressions -b and <:b and +/b the same verbs have valence 1. 
From these examples it is clear that the verbs are ambivalent , the valence being 
determined by the context in which they are used. We also say that a verb used with 
valence 1 is used  monadically , or is a  monad ; a verb used with valence 2 is a dyad . 
In the phrase 3&* the conjunction & bonds  the noun 3 to the verb * to produce a monad. 
Thus: 
   triple=: 3&* 
   triple a=: 1 2 3 4 3 6 9 12    square=: ^&2    square a 1 4 9 16     ^&3 a 1 8 27 64 
Although a is the list 1 2 3 4 , it should be noted that the phrase ^&3 1 2 3 4  is not 
equivalent to ^&3 a , because the sequence 3 1 2 3 4  is treated as a single list that is 
bonded to ^ to form a verb.  However, ^&3 (1 2 3 4)  and ^&3 a  are equivalent. 
The bond conjunction is extremely prolific because its use with any dyad d generates two 
families of monads, one using left bonding ( n&d) and one using right bonding ( d&n) . For 
example, with right bonding the verb ^ produces the square, cube, and higher powers; 
with left bonding it produces exponential verbs. 
The conjunction @ introduced in Section 1 G composes  two verbs, as in i.@- 3  to yield 
2 1 0 ; the verb i.@-  also has a dyadic meaning, as in 8 i.@- 3  to yield 0 1 2 3 4 . 
In general, v1@v2 b  is equivalent to v1 v2 b , and a v1@v2 b  is equivalent to v1 (a 
v2 b) . In effect, the monad v1 is applied “atop” the dyad v2, and the conjunction  @ 
(denoted by the commercial at symbol) is called atop.  
18  Arithmetic 
  
B. Commutativity 
The dyads + and * yield the same results if their arguments are interchanged or 
“commuted”, and they are therefore said to be commutative . For example: 
 
   3+5 5+3 (3*5)=(5*3) 8  8 1  
The dyad produced by the commute  or cross  adverb ~ “crosses” the bonds of the verb to 
which it is applied. Moreover, the monad produced by ~ duplicates its single argument. 
For example:   
 
   3-~5 5-3 2 2    +~3 ^~3 6 27     */~i.5 0 0 0  0  0 0 1 2  3  4 0 2 4  6  8 0 3 6  9 12 0 4 8 12 16 
C. Associativity 
Compare the results of the following pair s of sentences, which differ only in the 
“associations” produced by different punctuations: 
 
   (4+3)+(2+1) 4+((3+2)+1) 10 10    (4-3)-(2-1) 4-((3-2)-1) 0 4  (4>.3)>.(2>.1) 4>.((3>.2)>.1) 4 4   (4*3)*(2*1) 4*((3*2)*1) 24  24   (4^3)^(2^1) 4^((3^2)^1) 4096 262144  
Those verbs ( + >.  and *) that yield the same results are examples of associative  verbs; 
the others are non-associative . 
D. Distributivity 
The monad >: is said to distribute over  the dyad <. because a sentence such as (>:7) 
<. (>:4)  has the same result as the corresponding sentence >:(7<.4)  in which the 
 Chapter 2 Properties of Verbs  19 
  
monad >: is “distributed over” the result of the dyad <. . Observe the further tests of 
distributivity: 
 
   a=:7    b=:4    triple=: *&3    (triple a) + (triple b) triple (a+b) 33 33     (triple a) - (triple b) triple (a-b)  9 9     (*&3 a) <. (*&3 b) *&3 (a<.b)  12 12     (-&3 a) <. (-&3 b) -&3 (a<.b)  1    1     (3&- a) <. (3&- b) 3&- (a<.b)  _4 _1  
In the last two pairs of sentences it appears that although the monad -&3 (which subtracts 
3 from its argument) distributes over minimum, the monad 3&- (which subtracts its 
argument from 3) does not. 
This point is made to show the pitfall in a common practice in math, where it is stated 
that the dyad  * distributes over addition, rather than stating (as we do here) that the 
family *&n of right bonds of * distributes over addition. 
Because * is commutative, the left bond c&* is equivalent to the right bond *&c, and 
both distribute over addition. However, in  the case of a non-commutative verb such as 
subtraction, it is possible that a right bond with a given dyad distributes while the corresponding left bond does not. In such a case it is clearly incorrect to say that the dyad  
distributes, and one is led to statements such as “
- distributes to the right  over 
minimum”. 
A linear  verb (to be discussed further in Chapter 9) is one that distributes over addition. 
E. Symmetry 
If a dyad d (such as + or * or >.) is both associative and commutative, then the monad 
d/ produced by insertion is said to be symmetric , because it produces the same result 
when the argument list to which it applies is re-ordered or permuted . For example: 
   a=: 1 2 3 4 5 
   b=: 3 1 5 2 4    +/a +/b 15  15     */a */b 120 120     >./a >./b 
20  Arithmetic 
  
3 3 
   -/a -/b 3 9 
F. Display of Proverbs 
If a proverb is entered alone (t hat is, without arguments), its representation  is displayed. 
For example, if the proverbs of Sections F and G of Chapter 1 are already defined, then: 
 
   increment >:     add3 >:@>:@>:     identity <:@>: 
G. Inverses 
Review the discussion of inverses in Secti on C and Exercise G3 of Chapter 1. Then 
observe the results of the following uses of inversion: 
 
   a=:0 1 2 3 4 5    >:^:_1 a _1 0 1 2 3 4     >:^:_1 <    +&3^:_1 a _3 _2 _1 0 1 2     +&3^:_1 -&3     -&3^:_1 a 3 4 5 6 7 8     3&-^:_1 a 3 2 1 0 _1 _2     3&- 3&-^:3 a 0 1 2 3 4 5     3&-^:_1 3&- 
H. Partitions 
The sum of a list ( +/list ) is equal to the sum of sums over parts of the list, and a similar 
relation holds for some other verbs such as */ and >./ . For example: 
 Chapter 2 Properties of Verbs  21 
  
 
   +/3 1 4 1 5 9 (+/3 1)+(+/4 1 5 9) 23 23     */3 1 4 1 5 9 (*/3 1)*(*/4 1 5 9) 540 540     >./3 1 4 1 5 9 (>./3 1)>.(>./4 1 5 9) 9 9  
These relations can be expressed more clearly in terms of the truncation verbs take ({.) 
and drop  (}.). Thus: 
 
   a=:3 1 4 1 5 9    2{.a 3 1     2}.a 4 1 5 9     (+/2{.a)+(+/2}.a) +/a 23 23     (*/2{.a)*(*/2}.a) */a 540 540     (+/6{.a)+(+/6}.a) 23     (*/6{.a)*(*/6}.a) 540  
The last two examples are interesting because the list 6}.a  is empty, yet the results of +/ 
and */ upon it are such as to maintain the identities seen for the other cases. Thus: 
 
 +/6}.a */6}.a 0 1  
This matter is explored further in the succeeding section. 
I. Identity Elements and Infinity 
It is easy to verify that the monads 0&+ and 1&* and -&0 are identity  verbs that produce 
no change in their arguments. A noun that bonds w ith a dyad to form an identity verb is 
said to be an identity element  of that dyad. Thus, 1 is the identity element of *, and 0 is 
the identity element of + and of - . 
Although -&0 is an identity, 0&- is not. We may therefore say more precisely that 0 is a 
right  identity of - . The same is true for other non-commutative verbs. Thus, 1 is a right 
identity of ^ (power). 
22  Arithmetic 
  
To ensure that identities of the form (+/a)=(+/k{.a)+(+/k}.a)  remain true when 
one of the lists is empty, we define the result of d/b to be the identity element of d if the 
list b is empty. 
Does the dyad <. (minimum) possess an identity element? If h were a huge number (such 
as 10^9 ) then it would serve for all practical purposes as the identity element of 
minimum. However, since there is no largest number among the integers, we must again 
extend the domain by adding a new element, denoted by _ and called infinity . To provide 
an identity for maximum we also add a  negative infinity denoted by  __ . We will refer to 
the resulting domain as integers+ . Thus: 
 
   <./0#0 >./i.0 _ __ 
J. Experimentation 
In experimenting with expressions on the computer you will find that many verbs, 
adverbs, and conjunctions have meanings that are more general than the definitions given 
in the text.  For example: 
 
   halve=: 2&*^:_1    halve 2 4 6 8 10  halve 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5     sqr=:*~    sqrt=: sqr^:_1    sqrt 1 4 9 16 25 sqrt 1 2 3 4 5   1 2 3 4 5 1 1.41421 1.73205 2 2.23607     sqrt - 1 2 3 4 5 0j1 0j1.41421 0j1.73205 0j2 0j2.23607  
Some of the results of these experiments are fractions and complex numbers that lie 
outside the domain of integers treated thus fa r. There is no harm in experimenting further 
with any that interest you, but do not spend too much time on baffling matters that will be 
treated later in the text. 
K. Summary of Notation 
The notation introduced in this chapter comprises two nouns ( _ and __) for the identity 
elements of minimum and maximum; two verbs take and drop  ({. }. ) for truncating a 
list; the commute  adverb ~ ;  the conjunction & to bond nouns to dyads; and verbs 
produced by the atop conjunction @ have dyadic as well as monadic cases.  
L. On Language 
Use the computer to test the following assertions: 
1. The monad | yields the magnitude  or absolute value. 
2. The monad |. reverses its argument, and 3&|.  rotates it by three places. 
 Chapter 2 Properties of Verbs  23 
  
3. The monad -&| is equivalent to -@|, but the dyad -&| applies the dyad - to the 
result of applying the monad | to each argument. 
4. %&4 is division by 4, and is equivalent to 4&*^:_1  . 
5. The monads +: and -: are double  and halve . 
6. The monads *: and %: are square  and square root . 
7.  'abcde'  is the list of the first five letters  of the alphabet, and monads such as |. 
and 3&|.  and 3 4&$  apply to it.

 Partitions and Selections 
A. Partition Adverbs 
The partition adverb \ (called prefix ) applies to monads to produce many useful verbs. 
For example: 
 
   a=: 1 2 3 4 5    sum=: +/    sum a 15  
   sum\ a 
Subtotals or “running” sums  
1 3 6 10 15 
 
   (+/1),(+/1 2),(+/1 2 3),(+/1 2 3 4),(+/1 2 3 4 5) 1 3 6 10 15    +/\a 1 3 6 10 15  
   */\a

   !a 1 2 6 24 120  
   >./\ 3 1 4 1 5 9 
Running maxima  
3 3 4 4 5 9 
 
The partition adverb \. behaves similarly to produce a ve rb that applies to suffixes: 
 
   sum \.a 15 14 12 9 5     */\.a 120 120 60 20 5     <./\.3 1 4 1 5 9 
26  Arithmetic 
  
1 1 1 1 5 9 
    (*/\.a)*(*/\a) 120 240 360 480 600    (+/\.a)+(+/\a) 16 17 18 19 20     (-/\.a)-(-/\a) 2 _1 2 1 2  
The diagonal adverb /. applies to (forward sloping) diagonals of tables. It will later be 
seen to be useful in multiplying polynomials a nd integers expressed in decimal. It is also 
useful in treating correlations and convolutions: 
 
   t=:1 2 1*/1 2 1    t 1 2 1 2 4 2 1 2 1     sum/. t 1 4 6 4 1     (sum/. t)*(10^i.-5) 10000 4000 600 40 1     +/(sum/. t)*(10^i.-5) 14641    121*121 14641     +//.1 2 1*/1 3 3 1 1 5 10 10 5 1     +//.1 3 3 1*/1 4 6 4 1 1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1  
B. Selection Verbs 
The take and drop  ({. and }.) used in Section 2 H are examples of selection verbs. A 
more general selection is provided by the verb { (called from ). For example: 
 
   primes=:2 3 5 7 11 13 
   2{primes 5     0 2 4{primes 2 5 11     3{.primes 
 Chapter 3  Partitions And Selections  27 
  
2 3 5 
   (i.3){primes 2 3 5     (i.-#primes){primes 13 11 7 5 3 2     i.3 5  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14     0 2{i.3 5  0  1  2  3  4 10 11 12 13 14     2 1 3 5 0 4{primes 5 3 7 13 2 11  
The last sentence above is an example of a permutation  that reorders the items of the list 
primes ; a list such as 2 1 3 5 0 4  that produces a permutation is called a permutation 
list, or permutation vector , or simply a permutation . 
If the items of a list a are distinct, then the selection b=: i{a  has an inverse in the sense 
that for a given b, an index can be found that selects it. The dyad i. fulfills this purpose, 
and is called indexing . For example: 
 
   a=:2 3 5 7 11 13    ]b=:3{a 7     a i. b 3     a i. 11 2 5 4 0 2  
More precisely, the monads {&a and a&i.  are mutually inverse. For example:  
 
   psel=: {&2 3 5 7 11 13    pind=: 2 3 5 7 11 13&i.    pind 7 2 3 0     psel pind 7 2 7 2 
A list such as a specifies a set of intervals, and an integer may be classified according to 
the interval in which it falls. More precisely,  we will determine the index of the largest 
element in the list that equals or precedes it. Thus, 5 and 6 both lie in interval 2 of a 
because they are greater than or equal to 2{a and less than 3{a. 
Indexing can be used to perform the classification as follows: 
28  Arithmetic 
  
 
   a 2 3 5 7 11 13     x=: 6    x<a 0 0 0 1 1 1     (x<a) i. 1 3     ]i=: <:(x<a)i.1 2     i{a 5 
C. Grade and Sort 
The monad /: grades its argument. For example: 
    p=: 5 3 7 13 2 11    /:p 4 1 0 2 5 3     (/:p){p 2 3 5 7 11 13  
More precisely, the monad /: produces a permutation vector that can be used to sort its 
argument to ascending order. 
D. Residue 
Just as the introduction of the predecessor as the inverse of the successor led to a new 
class of numbers outside the class of counting numbers, so an attempt to introduce an inverse to a multiplication such as 
5&* leads to new numbers when applied to an integer 
such as 17 that is not an integer multiple of 5. In other words, 17 is not in the (integer) 
domain of the inverse 5&*^:_1 . Similar remarks apply to an arbitrary multiple m&*. 
An approximate inverse in integers can be  obtained by locating the argument in the 
intervals specified by the multiples 5*i.n  . For example: 
 
   x=: 17    m5=: 5*i.6    m5 0 5 10 15 20 25     d=: <:(x<m5)i. 1    d  5*d 3 15     r=: x-5*d 
 Chapter 3  Partitions And Selections  29 
  
   r 
2    5|x 2 
The result r is the difference between the original  argument and the nearest multiple of 5 
that does not exceed it; it is called the residue of x modulo 5, or the 5-residue  of x . 
The dyad | is called residue , and x-m|x  is an integer multiple of m. Consequently it is in 
the domain of the inverse m&*^:_1 . Thus: 
 
   a=: i. 21    a 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20    8|a 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4    a-8|a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 16 16 16 16 16     8&*^:_1 a-8|a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2     10&*^:_1 a-10|a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 
E. Characters 
In English, the word Milk refers to a white liquid, whereas ‘Milk’ refers to the list of four 
literal characters ‘M’ and ‘i’ and ‘l’ and ‘k’.  We will use quotes in a similar manner, as 
illustrated below: 
 
   alph=: ' ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'    9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 22 0 22 0 22 9 0 22 9 9 { alph I II III IV V VI VII     t=: 4>*/~ 3 2 1 0 1 2 3    t t { ' *' 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 *** 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 *** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ******* 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ******* 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ******* 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 *** 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 ***

|1 2 3|^|4| +-----+-+-+ 
F. Box and Open 
The word-formation  verb ;: can be applied to a character  list that represents a sentence 
to break it into its individual words. Thus: 
 
   letters=: 'abc=:i.3 4+2'    words=: ;: letters    words 
+---+--+--+---+-+-+ 
|abc|=:|i.|3 4|+|2| +---+--+--+---+-+-+ 
 
   #words 
6 
   (i.-#words){words 
+-+-+---+--+--+---+ 
|2|+|3 4|i.|=:|abc| +-+-+---+--+--+---+ 
As illustrated, the result of the word-formati on is a list of six items, each of which is a 
boxed list representing the corresponding word. 
A single box can also be formed by the box monad < as follows:  
 
   <'abcd' 
+----+ 
|abcd| +----+ 
 
   <2 3 5 
+-----+ 
|2 3 5| +-----+ 
 
   (<(<'abcd'),<2 3 5),<2 3$(<'abcd'),<2 3 5 
+------------+-------------------+ 
|            |+-----+-----+-----+| |+----+-----+||abcd |2 3 5|abcd || ||abcd|2 3 5||+-----+-----+-----+| |+----+-----+||2 3 5|abcd |2 3 5|| |            |+-----+-----+-----+| +------------+-------------------+ 
The box verb  can also be very helpful in clarifying the behaviour of the partition 
adverbs. For example:     
 
   <\a=:1 2 3 4 5 
+-+---+-----+-------+---------+ 
|1|1 2|1 2 3|1 2 3 4|1 2 3 4 5| +-+---+-----+-------+---------+
 
 
   <\.a 
+---------+-------+-----+---+-+

+-+---+-----+-----+----+--+ 
|0|1 4|2 5 8|3 6 9|7 10|11| +-+---+-----+-----+----+--+ 
The monad > is the inverse of box; where necessary it “pads” the result with appropriate 
zeros or spaces. For example: 
   ]a=: ;: 'Gaily into Ruislip gardens' 
+-----+----+-------+-------+ 
|Gaily|into|Ruislip|gardens| +-----+----+-------+-------+    >a Gaily   into    Ruislip gardens

 Representation of Integers 
A. Introduction 
Because we are so familiar with the decimal number system (which extends 
systematically to larger and larger numbers ), the matter of distinct representations of 
successive counting numbers did not pose an obvious problem. However, in a system such as Roman numerals, the sequence I II III IV V VI VII has no clear pattern of continuation beyond a few thousand. 
Although the decimal system is familiar, a careful examination of it is fruitful because it 
leads to simple procedures for determini ng the results of verbs such as addition, 
multiplication, and power. We begin by e xpressing the relationship of a single number 
(such as the number of days in a year) to the list of decimal digits that represent it: 
 
   n=:365 d=:3 6 5 e=:2 1 0    10^e 100 10 1    d*10^e +/d*10^e 300 60 5 365  
The name e was chosen for the list 2 1 0  because the right argument of the power verb 
is often called an exponent . It could have been expressed using the verb i. as follows:  
 
   i. -3 2 1 0    +/d*10^i.-3 365  
The foregoing expression is, of course, suitable only for a list d of three items. To write a 
more general expression for any list d it is necessary to use a verb that yields the number 
of items of its list argument. Thus:  
 
   #d      +/d*10^i.-#d 3 365    d=:1 7 7 6    +/d*10^i.-#d  
34  Arithmetic 
  
1776 
The foregoing is an example of determining the base-10 value  of a list of digits, and 
similar expressions apply for other number bases  or radices . Thus: 
 
   +/d*8^i.-#d 245     b=:1 1 0 1    +/b*2^i.-#b 13     10#.d 365     8#.d 245     2#.b 13  
The last three sentences s how the use of the dyad #. (called base-value ) for the same 
evaluations. 
B. Addition 
Two lists representing numbers in decimal ma y be added to produce a representation of 
their sum, as illustrated below: 
 
   year=:3 6 5    agnes=: 3 0 4    base10=:10&#.    year + agnes 6 6 9     base10 (year + agnes) 669     (base10 year) + (base10 agnes) 669     year+year 6 12 10     base10 (year+year) 730     (base10 year)+(base10 year) 730  
Although the sum year+year  yields the correct sum when evaluated by base10 , it is 
not in the usual normal  form with each item in the list lying in the interval from 0 to 9. It 
Chapter 4  Representation of Integers  35  
  
can be brought to normal form by subtracting 10 from each of the last two items and 
“carrying” ones to the preceding items to obtain the result 7 3 0  in normal form. 
Since a zero can be appended to the beginning of a list without changing its decimal 
value, lists of different lengths can be adde d by appending leading zeros to the shorter. 
For example: 
   dozen=:1 2 
   base10 0,dozen 12     year+0,dozen 3 7 7 
C. Multiplication 
A procedure for multiplication will first be stat ed, and its validity will then be examined: 
 
   a1=:3 6 5 
   b1=: 1 7 7 6    (base10 a1)*(base10 b1) 648240     over=: ({.;}.)@":@,      by=: ' '&;@,.@[,.]    a1 by b1 over a1*/b1 
+-+----------+ 
| |1  7  7  6| +-+----------+ |3|3 21 21 18| |6|6 42 42 36| |5|5 35 35 30| +-+----------+ 
 
   a1*/b1 3 21 21 18 6 42 42 36 5 35 35 30     ]p=:+//.a1*/b1 3 27 68 95 71 30      base10 p 648240  
Normalization of p by carries gives  6 4 8 2 4 0  and: 
   base10 6 4 8 2 4 0 648240 
The foregoing procedure for multiplication comprises three steps: 
 1. Form the multiplication table of the lists of digits.  2. Sum the diagonals of the table.  3. Normalize the sums. 
36  Arithmetic 
  
The method is less error-prone than the one commonly taught, which distributes the 
normalization process through both the multiplication and summation phases. The validity of the process may be discerned from the following examples:  
 
   a1=:3 6 5    b1=:1 7 7 6    a2=:10^2 1 0    b2=:10^3 2 1 0    a=:a1*a2    b=:b1*b2    a    b 300 60 5 1000 700 70 6      (+/a)*(+/b) 648240     a*/b 300000 210000 21000 1800  60000  42000  4200  360   5000   3500   350   30     +/a*/b 365000 255500 25550 2190 
 
   +/+/a*/b 648240 
 
The fact that the product of the sums +/a and +/b can be expressed as the sum of 
products arises from two properties: 
 1. Multiplication distributes over addition.  2. Summation (
+/) is symmetric. 
In the expression a*/b , the arguments are themselves products and, because 
multiplication is both associative and commutative, a*/b  can also be expressed as the 
product of two tables as follows: 
   a1*/b1 
3 21 21 18 6 42 42 36 5 35 35 30     a2*/b2 100000 10000 1000 100  10000  1000  100  10   1000   100   10   1     (a1*/b1)*(a2*/b2) a*/b 300000 210000 21000 1800 300000 210000 21000 1800  60000  42000  4200  360  60000  42000  4200  360   5000   3500   350   30 5000   3500   350   30  
Each element of the table a1*/b1  is multiplied by the corresponding element from the 
“powers of ten” table a2*/b2 , and those elements of a1*/b1  multiplied by the same 
power of ten can be first summed and then  multiplied by it. Since equal powers lie on 
Chapter 4  Representation of Integers  37  
  
diagonals, the sums are made along these diagonals, as in the expression 
p=:+//.a1*/b1  used in describing the multiplication procedure. 
The reason that equal powers lie on diagona ls can be made clear by noting that a2 equals 
10^e=:2 1 0 , that b2 equals 10^f=:3 2 1 0 , and that a2*/b2  equals 10^e+/f  : 
 
   e+/f 10^e+/f 
5 4 3 2 100000 10000 1000 100 4 3 2 1 10000  1000  100  10 3 2 1 0 1000   100   10   1 
D. Normalization 
The normalization process used in Section B can be expressed more formally. We first 
define the main verbs to be used, and illustrate their use:  
 
   base10=:10&#. 
   residue=: 10&|    tithe=: 10&*^:_1    n=: 98 45 19 24    base10 n 102714     remainder=: residue n    remainder 8 5 9 4     n-remainder 90 40 10 20     carry=: tithe n-remainder    carry 9 4 1 2     carry ,: remainder   (,: laminates lists to form a table) 
9 4 1 2 8 5 9 4     +//. carry ,: remainder 9 12 6 11 4     base10 +//. carry ,: remainder 102714 
We begin by specifying a “temporary” name t, and repeatedly re-assign to it the result of 
the process illustrated above: 
   t=: n 
   t=:+//. (tithe t-residue t) ,: residue t     t 9 12 6 11 4     base10 t 102714 
38  Arithmetic 
  
 
   t=:+//. (tithe t-residue t) ,: residue t    t  base10 t 0 10 2 7 1 4 102714     t=:+//. (tithe t-residue t) ,: residue t    base10 t 102714  
We will now use trains  of isolated verbs (to be discussed below) to capture the foregoing 
process in a single verb, as follows: 
 
   reduce=: +//.@ ((tithe @ (] - residue)) ,: residue)    reduce n 9 12 6 11 4     reduce ^:3 n 0 1 0 2 7 1 4     reduce^:4 n 0 0 1 0 2 7 1 4  
Because further repetitions of reduce  continue to append leading zeros, we will instead 
use trim@reduce , where trim  is defined to trim off a leading zero: 
 
   trim=:0&=@(0&{) }. ]    (trim @ reduce)^:3 n 1 0 2 7 1 4   norm=: trim@reduce^:_  
Three repetitions suffice for the argument n, but in general the number required is 
unknown. However, since the process v^:k  stops when the successive results stop 
changing, it suffices to use a sufficiently large value of k, preferably infinity. 
We now consider the trains used in the definitions of reduce  and trim . The phrase ] - 
residue  occurring in the former has an obvious meaning, as illustrated below: 
 
   ] - residue n _8 _5 _9 _4  
However, the same sequence of three verbs is olated by parentheses (as they are in the 
definition of reduce ) is called a train , and has the meaning illustrated below:  
 
   (] - residue) n 90 40 10 20    (]n) - (residue n) 90 40 10 20     (3&< <. 9&>) i. 15 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 
Chapter 4  Representation of Integers  39  
  
 
   (3&< i.15) <. (9&> i.15) 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  
Thus, the middle verb in a train of three app lies dyadically to the results of the outer 
verbs. Such a train also has a dyadic meaning defined similarly. For example:  
 
   3 (+*-) 7 _40     (3+7)*(3-7) _40     3 (< >. =) 2 3 4 5 0 1 1 1    3<:2 3 4 5 0 1 1 1 
E. Mixed Bases 
The base-value dyad #. used in Section A with the simple bases 10 and 8 and 2 can also 
be used with a mixed  base defined by a list. For example: 
 
   base=: 7 24 60 60    base #. 0 1 2 3 
3723 
# of seconds in 0 days, 1 hour, 2 minutes, 3 seconds 
 
   a=:i. 2 4    a 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7    base #. a 3723 363967     base #: 3723 0 1 2 3     base#: base #. a 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
The last results illustrate the fact that the dyad #: provides an inverse to the base value, 
and can be used to produce the list representati ons of integers in any base. For example:  
   2 2 2 #: i. 8 
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 
40  Arithmetic 
  
1 1 0 
1 1 1     10 10 10 #: 24 60 365 0 2 4 0 6 0 3 6 5     fbase=: 3-i. 3    fbase 3 2 1    fbase #: i.!3 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 
The final example employs an unusual “factorial”  base, that will be used in the discussion 
of permutations in Chapter 7. 
F. Experimentation 
The verb mag=: ] >. -  yields the  magnitude  of its argument; for example, mag 9 _9  
yields 9 9. However, the monad | does the same. 
Although it is probably unwise to spend time me morizing bits of notation  before they 
arise in context, it is worthwhile to expe riment with the monadic cases of dyads already 
encountered (and conversely), and to adopt those that appear useful. The language 
summary at the back of the book can be used to  suggest further experiments. It is also 
worthwhile to experiment with the use of tables and other higher-rank arrays such as the 
rank-3 array i. 2 3 4  and the rank-4 array i. 2 3 4 5 . Three matters merit attention: 
1. Just as the insertion +/ inserts the verb + between items of a list, so does it 
between items  of a higher rank array: between the rows  of a table, and between the 
planes  of a rank-3 array. Consequently, +/ applied to a table adds one row to 
another. For example: 
 
   i. 3 4 +/i. 3 4 0 1  2  3 12 15 18 21 4 5  6  7 8 9 10 11 
2. Expressions such as a */ b , already used to form tables when applied to lists, 
also apply to higher-rank arrays. For example: 
 
   2 3 5 */ i. 2 4  0  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 
 
 0  3  6  9 12 15 18 21

3. The rank conjunction " determines the rank of the sub-array to which a verb 
applies. For example: 
 
  sum=:+/     ]a=:i. 2 3   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11  12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23     sum a                sum"2 a          sum"1 a 12 14 16 18          12 15 18 21       6 22 38 20 22 24 26          48 51 54 57      54 70 86 28 30 32 34

 Proofs 
A. Introduction 
A proof is an exposition intended to convince a reader that a certain relation is true, and 
perhaps to provide some insight into why it is true. For example, Section O of Chapter 1 
provided, in passing, an illustration that the sum of the first six odd numbers was equal to six times six, that is, the square of six. Thus: 
 
   odds=:1+2*i. k=:6    odds 1 3 5 7 9 11     +/odds 36     k*k 36     *:k 36     *:#odds 36  
This relation for the case of six odds suggests that a similar relation might hold for any 
number, and the prefix scan ( \) provides a convenient test: 
 
   d=:1+i.15    d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15     odds=:1+2*i.15    odds 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29     +/\odds 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121 144 169 196 225 
44 
  
   *:d 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121 144 169 196 225  
This result provides rather strong evidence that the sum +/1+2*i.k  equals the square of 
k for any value of k, but it provides no insight into why this should be so. 
The following numbered sequence of sentences begins and ends with the pair whose 
equivalence is to be established. The interm ediate sentences differ in simple ways that 
can provide insight into why the relations would hold true for any value of k: 
 
S1 odds=:1+2*i.k=:10     odds  1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19  S2  +/odds  100  S3 |.odds  19 17 15 13 11 9 7 5 3 1  S4 +/|.odds  100  S5 -: (+/odds) + (+/|.odds)  (-: halves its argument) 
 100  S6 -: +/ (odds+|.odds)  100  S7 +/ -: (odds+|.odds)  100  S8 odds+|.odds  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  S9 -: odds+|.odds  10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10  S10  k#k  10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10  S11 +/k#k  100  S12 k*k  100  S13 *:k  100 
Sentences S2 and S4 to S7 show that the sum of the first ten odds can be written in 
several equivalent ways, but really demonstrate it only for the specific case of k=:10 . 
45 
    
However, we may see reasons to believe that the relations between successive 
sentences should hold for other values of k. 
For example,  because +/ is symmetric (as defined in Section 2 E), and because the 
monad |. permutes its argument, S2 and S4 agree for any list odds  . Further, in S5, one-
half of the sum of two equal things is equal to either one of them, and similarly simple 
arguments can establish the equality of the pairs S6, S7; S7, S11; S11, S12; and S12, S13. In particular, S12 agrees with S11 because their agreement expresses the definition  
of multiplication. 
We will call a sequence such as S1-S13 an informal  proof; it provides insight but leaves 
to the reader the task of providing precise reas ons for the equivalence of certain pairs of 
sentences. A formal proof is one in which each sentence is annotated by a clear statement 
of the reasons for its equivalence with an earlier sentence. 
An informal proof is satisfactory only if the relations between successive sentences are 
obvious to the reader. If so, why is it ever desirable to make formal a good informal 
proof? Firstly, what is obvious to one reader  may not be to another. A second, more 
serious, reason is that obvious reasons for relations may, in fact, be wrong, or at least 
incomplete. 
For example, does 
+/1+2*i.k  equal k*k for the case k=:0  ? The answer is yes, but this 
does not follow from the arguments given thus far, since they took no account of the 
definition of the summation of an empty list. A complete proof would require examination of the definition of identity elements in Section 2 I. 
In the foregoing example the conclusion re mained correct even though the reasons 
provided were incomplete, but unexamined proofs and definitions can also lead to errors 
or contradictions. For example, the prime  numbers illustrated in Exercise O1 of Chapter 1 
have the important property that any counti ng number greater than one can be expressed 
as a product of one or more primes, and that this factorization  is unique. For example, 
using the first five elements of the list obtained in the cited exercise: 
 
   pr=:2 3 5 7 11    e=:2 0 2 1 0    pr^e 4 1 25 7 1    */pr^e 700  
Thus, the exponents 2 0 2 1 0  specify the prime factorization of the integer 700, and 
no other factorization in primes is possible. 
We turn now to a definition of primes that is commonly used in high-school: A prime is 
an integer that is divisible only by itself and one. The integers in the list pr satisfy this 
condition, but so does the integer 1. We now consider a list of “primes” that includes 1, 
and see that the factorization of the integer 700 in terms of it is not unique: 
 
   p=:pr,1 
   p 2 3 5 7 11 1     */p^2 0 2 1 0 0 700    */p^2 0 2 1 0 3 
46 
 700 
The loss of unique factorization clearly lies in a definition of primes that admits 1 as a 
member. We turn to an informal development of primes that leads to a suitable definition: 
 
   i=:>:i.8 
    i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
    rem=: i|/i div=: 0= i|/i 
   rem div 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
 
   +/div 1 2 2 3 2 4 2 4     2=+/div 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0     (2=+/div)#i 2 3 5 7  
The table rem is the table of remainders (or residues), and div is a divisibility table that 
identifies zero remainders. The sum +/div  sums the columns of div to yield the number 
of divisors of each of the integers i, and the final sentence selects those integers that have 
exactly two distinct divisors. It furnishes a su itable definition: A prime is an integer that 
has exactly two distinct divisors. 
We conclude this section with an example of an informal development designed to clarify 
some matters of elementary algebra.  
The expression a3 is commonly used to denote what we denote here by a^3, and is 
defined by saying that it is the product of three factors a (which we would write as 
a*a*a ) but also by continuing to define a0 as 1. What is meant by a product of no 
factors, and why should its result be 1 ? Somewhat less mysteriously, what is a product of 
one factor ( a1), and why should it yield a ? 
The definitions of expressions such as a^n and !n are commonly extended to arguments 
that do not fall under the initial definition, by extending them so as to maintain certain 
significant “patterns” or “identities”. These patterns can often be made clear by applying functions to lists (such as 
i.n) that themselves maintain si mple patterns. For example: 
 
   a=:4     e=:3 4 5     a^e 
47 
    
64 256 1024 
To evaluate the next in sequence (that is, a^6), one might perform the calculation 
4*4*4*4*4*4  or, more efficiently, note that the result is simply 4 times the preceding 
case a^5. In other words, the pattern extends to the right by multiplication by 4. 
Consequently, and more interestingly, it proceeds to the left by division by 4. Thus, since 
4^3 is 64, it follows that 4^2 is 16, that 4^1 is 4, and that 4^0 is 1.  
These last two results provide some insight into why a^1 and a^0 are defined as a and 1 
for any a, including the case where a itself is zero. It is worth noting that some college 
texts state that 0^0 is undefined, even though the result 1 is clearly needed to make it 
possible to evaluate the general form of the polynomial in x with coefficients c, namely, 
+/c*x^i.#c . 
Going, for a moment, outside the domain of the integers, we may also note that the 
pattern continues through negativ e and fractional values. Thus: 
 
   a=:4    e=:3 4 5    a^e 64 256 1024     e=:3-~i.7    e _3 _2 _1 0 1 2 3     4^e 0.015625 0.0625 0.25 1 4 16 64     f=:-:i.6    f 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5     4^f 1 2 4 8 16 32  
In the final example, there are two steps ra ther than one between successive integers of 
the equally-spaced elements of the exponent f, and 4^f must therefore exhibit a pattern 
of multiplication by a factor which applied twice produces multiplication by 4; in other 
words, a factor that is the square root  of 4. 
B. Formal and Informal Proofs 
Although topics in mathematics are often presented deductively , as a sequence of formal 
proofs that appear to lead to collections of i ndisputable facts, we will continue to use an 
informal approach that emphasizes the use of expressions (such as the pair +/\odds  and 
*:d of Section A) that suggest relations, and sequences of expressions (such as S1-S13) 
that outline a proof. 
The reasons for adopting such an informal a pproach are rooted mainly in the view of 
mathematics expressed clearly and entertainingly in the dialogue in Lakatos’ Proofs and 
Refutations  [5] (discussed briefly in Section C), but also in the characteristics of the 
48 
 notation used here; characteristics that make it easy to express patterns in lists and tables, 
and to display them accurately and effortlessly by entering the expressions on a computer. 
To appreciate these characteristics the reader should attempt to render various 
expressions in this text clearly and comple tely in more conventional notation. For 
example, 
+/odds  may be expressed by using sigma notation, but +/\odds  would 
probably be expressed as: 
 
        i 
 ci = Σ oddsi   
       j=1 
an expression that does not yield an entire list as does +/\odds , but specifies it indirectly 
by specifying each of the elements of some list denoted by c. 
In a similar vein, it might be assumed that the sigma notation used for +/odds  would 
also serve for +/|.odds  as follows: 
 n 1  
 Σ  oddsi Σ  oddsi 
       i=1 i=n 
 
However, the summation from n to 1 is normally taken to denote summation over an 
empty set, since no summation from j to k could otherwise denote the empty case. 
It might also be noted that the symbol n commonly used in sigma notation has no clear 
connection to the number of elements in the argument, and cannot be expressed as a 
function of the argument without in troducing some notation analogous to #odds . 
C. Proofs and Refutations 
Of his Proofs and Refutations  [4], Lakatos says “Its modest aim is to elaborate the point 
that informal, quasi-empirical, mathematics does not grow through the monotonous increase of the number of indubitably established theorems but through the incessant improvement of guesses by speculation and criticism, by the logic of proofs and refutations.” 
He goes on to say that there is a simple pattern of mathematical discovery - or of the 
growth of informal mathematical theories - that consists of the following stages (also 
quoted from [4]): 
1. Primitive conjecture 2. Proof (a rough thought-experiment or argument, decomposing the primitive 
conjecture into sub-conjectures or lemmas). 
3. ‘Global’ counterexamples (counterexamples to the primitive conjecture) emerge. 4. Proof re-examined: the ‘guilty lemma’ to which the global counter-example is a 
‘local’ counterexample is spotted. This  ‘guilty’ lemma may have previously 
remained ‘hidden’ or may have been misi dentified. Now it is made explicit, and 
built into the primitive conjecture as a condition. The theorem - the improved conjecture - supersedes the primitive conj ecture with the new proof-generated 
concept as its paramount new feature. 
49 
    
As a result, “Counterexamples are turned  into new examples - new fields of 
inquiry open up.” 
Lakatos illustrates this process by following a simple conjecture through surprising twists 
and turns, citing positions held by dozens of eminent mathematicians. To quote from a review cited on the cover, “The whole book,  as well as being a delightful read, is of 
immense value to anyone concerned with mathematical education at any level.” 
We will illustrate the process briefly. Having counted the number of vertices 
v, edges e, 
and faces f of various polyhedra (bounded by multiple flat faces , surfaces , or “seats” as 
suggested by the root hedra ), a class arrives at the conjecture that the expression f+v-e  
yields 2 for any polyhedron. For example: 
 f v e f+v-e  
Tetrahedron  4 4 6 2 
Square-base pyramid 5 5 8 2  
Cube 6 8 12 2 
The teacher provides the following proof or “thought-experiment” to establish the 
validity of the relation for all polyhedra: 
1. Triangulate each face by (repeatedly) drawing a line between some pair of 
vertices not already joined by an edge. [In the square-based pyramid this requires one diagonal on the base; in the cube it requires one diagonal on each face.] Since each line drawn adds one edge and one face (splitting one existing face into 
two), the triangulation does not change the result of 
f+v-e . 
2. Remove one face, leaving a hole bounded by three edges. 
3. Dismantle the body triangle-by-triangle until only one remains, removing at each 
step one edge and one face, or one vertex , two edges, and one face. Either action 
leaves f+v-e  unchanged. 
4. For the final triangle, f+v-e  is 1+3-3  (that is, 1), which, together with the face 
removed in step 2, gives a result of 2 for f+v-e . 
The validity of each step of the process is challenged by students who enter the dialogue, 
and the validity of the conjecture itself is challenged by counterexamples, including one 
provided by a body formed by fitting together in to a square “picture frame” four identical 
moldings (polyhedra) having the following end and side views: 
 
   __         __________________________ 
  /  \     /                          \  /    \
      /                            \  
 
A direct count gives 16+16-32  or 0, contradicting the conjecture. 
Attempts are first made to sharpen the de finition of a polyhedron so as to save the 
conjecture by barring the picture frame from c onsideration (as a “monster”), and later to 
revise the conjecture so as to account for such a monster. 
One such revision is based on the observation that the “well-behaved” polyhedra shared 
the property that (if constructed of elastic surf aces) they could be inflated to a sphere, but 
the picture frame could not. Moreover, a single cut through one limb of the frame (which 
50 
 would appear as a vertical line in the side view above) would form a body with two new 
faces, eight new vertices, and eight new edges, restoring the result of 2 for f+v-e , and 
producing a body that could be inflated to a sphere. 
A revised conjecture taking into account the “connectedness” or “number of cuts needed 
to produce a ‘spherical’ body” can therefore be formulated; but it again is subject to further criticism and refinement. 
We conclude this section with an ex tended quotation from Lakatos (page 73): 
TEACHER
: No! Facts do not suggest conjectures and do not support them either! 
BETA : Then what suggested 2=f+v-e  to me if not the facts, listed in my 
table? 
TEACHER : I shall tell you. You yourself said you failed many times to fit them 
into a formula. Now what happened was this: you had three or four conjectures which in turn were quickly refuted. Your table was built up in the process of testing and refuting these conjectures. These dead and now forgotten conjectures suggested the facts, not the facts the conjectures. Naive conjectures are not inductive conjectures: we arrive 
at them by trial and error, through conjectures and refutations.  But if 
you - wrongly - believe that you arrived at them inductively, from your tables, if you believe that the longer the table, the more conjectures it will suggest, and later support, you may waste your time compiling unnecessary data. Also, being indoctrinated that the path of discovery is from facts to conjecture, and from conjecture to proof (the myth of induction), you may completely forget  about the heuristic alternative: 
deductive guessing. 
D. Proofs 
Throughout this text we will present examples intended to stimulate the formulation of conjectures, but will not develop proofs. Howeve r, the reader is encouraged to provide 
formal and informal proofs for any conject ures that suggest themselves. The present 
section will provide examples of proofs of identities that are familiar in elementary mathematics, but are often treated in more limited forms. 
In this section we will use the name 
X to denote a single element (or scalar ), and other 
names to denote lists (or vectors ). We will write one sentence below another to indicate 
that they are equivalent. Thus: 
Thm1: +/X*W 
 X*+/W 
asserts that the sum over a scalar times a list is equivalent to the scalar times the sum 
over the list, and labels the identity as Th m1 (Theorem 1) for future reference. 
A formal proof of a theorem is provided by annotating each sentence after the first with 
the reason that it is equivalent to the sentence preceding it. Thus: 
Thm1: +/X*W 
     X*+/W X&*  distributes over +   (Section 2 D) 
If values are assigned to the names used in  a theorem, then each sentence may be 
entered and executed as a test for the case of the particular values assigned. Thus: 
51 
    
 
   X=: 3    W=: 3 1 4 1    +/X*W 27     X*+/W 27  
This executability is reassuring in devel oping an identity or proof, because a mis-
statement will very likely produce a different result. For example: 
 
Thm2: V=: 2 4 6 
 
 +/V*/W 
  36 12 48 12 
 
 (+/V)*W Thm1 applied for each element of W 
  36 12 48 12 (since +/V is a scalar)  
 
A sequence of equivalent sentences implies that  the first sentence is equivalent to the 
last. Hence the following is a formal proof that the sum of the column sums of the 
multiplication table V*/W  equals the product of the sums +/V and +/W: 
 
Thm3: +/+/V*/W 
 
    +/V*(+/W)  Thm2 and commutativity of * 
 
    (+/V)*(+/W) Thm1 (with +/W for X and V for W) 
 and commutativity of *. 
 
The following theorem can be proved formally by showing that the element of column j 
of row i of the first table is equal to the corresponding element of the second table: 
Thm4: (A*P)*/(B*Q) 
     (A*/B)*(P*/Q) 
 
It can be illustrated as follows: 
 
   A=:2 3 5 
   B=: 3 1 4 1    P=: 4 3 2    Q=: 2 7 1 8 
 
   (A*P)*/(B*Q) 
48 56 32 64 54 63 36 72 60 70 40 80     (A*/B)*(P*/Q) 48 56 32 64 54 63 36 72 60 70 40 80 
52 
  
Since x^n is defined by */n#x , it is easy to show that (x^n)*(x^m)  is equivalent to 
x^(m+n) . This result can be used in th e proof of the following theorem: 
Thm5: (X^A)*/(X^B) 
     X^(A+/B) 
The foregoing theorems will be used in an ex ercise in Section B of Chapter 9 to prove 
that the product of two polynomials with coefficients C and D is equivalent to a 
polynomial with coefficients +//.C*/D . 
The fact that multiplication distributes over addition is commonly extended to a product 
of sums and expressed in conventional notation as: 
LHS= (a+A)(b+B) RHS= (ab)+(aB)+(Ab)+(AB) the left-hand side LHS being equiva lent to the right-hand side RHS. 
This identity can be extended to a product over any number of sums as follows: LHS=(a+A)(b+B)(c+C) 
RHS=(abc)+(abC)+(aBc)+(aBC)+(Abc)+(AbC)+(ABc)+(ABC) LHS=(a+A)(b+B) ... (z+Z) The last expression above uses the informal three-dot notation to suggest continuation of 
the same form to arbitrary lengths. To a ppreciate the difficulties of such informal 
notation, the reader should attempt its use in a clear definition of the corresponding right-hand side. 
The use of vectors (lists) makes the expression of the left-hand side simple: 
*/v1+v2  , 
where (in the three-element case above), v1=:a,b,c  and v2=:A,B,C . 
To clarify the pattern of the right-hand side, we will use explicit values for v1 and v2, 
thus allowing the direct evaluation of every expression. We will also use numbers less 
than ten in v1, and greater than ten in v2 to make patterns easier to recognize. Thus: 
 
   v1=:2 3 4     v2=:12 13 14 v1+v2    14 16 18    ]LHS=: */v1+v2 4032     ]RHS=:(2*3*4)+(2*3*14)+(2*13*4)+(2*13*14)+(12*3*4)+               (12*3*14)+(12*13*4)+(12*13*14) 4032  
The pattern in the expression for RHS can be better seen in the following table:  
 
   M=:>2 3 4;2 3 14;2 13 4;2 13 14;12 3 4;12 3 14;               12 13 4;12 13 14 
 
 
53 
    
 
   M 
 2  3  4  2  3 14  2 13  4  2 13 14 12  3  4 12  3 14 12 13  4 12 13 14     */"1 M 24 84 104 364 144 504 624 2184     +/*/"1 M 4032 
Because the items of v2 exceed 10, the pattern in M can be displayed more clearly as 
booleans: 
 
   ]b1=: M<10 ]b2=: M>10 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1  
The right-hand side can now be expressed in either of two ways: 
    ]RHS=: +/(*/"1 v1^b1)*(*/"1 v2^b2) 4032     ]RHS=: +/*/"1 (v1,v2)^(b1,.b2) 4032  
The details of these expressions can be explor ed by displaying the partial results. For 
example, the rows of v1^b1  contain the appropriate elements from v1 with the elements 
from v2 being replaced by ones (the identity element of *), and the product over the 
rows multiplied by the product over the rows of v2^b2  yields the products to be 
summed. Thus: 
   v1^b1 v2^b2 
2 3 4   1  1  1 2 3 1   1  1 14 2 1 4    1 13  1 2 1 1    1 13 14 1 3 4   12  1  1 1 3 1   12  1 14 1 1 4   12 13  1 
54 
 1 1 1   12 13 14 
    */"1 v1^b1 24 6 8 2 12 3 4 1    */"1 v2^b2 1 14 13 182 12 168 156 2184 
 
   (*/"1 v1^b1)*(*/"1 v2^b2) 24 84 104 364 144 504 624 2184 
 
   +/(*/"1 v1^b1)*(*/"1 v2^b2) 4032 
 
Comparison of b2 with the result of #:i.2^3  in Exercise F1 of Chapter 4 should make 
it clear that #:i.2^n  is the table appropriate to any list v of n elements. Moreover, as 
illustrated in Exercise F2 of Chapter 4, the verb t=: ,"1~&0, ,"1~&1  
applied to #:i.2^n  yields the table for a list of one more element. 
The foregoing facts can be used to forma lize the following proof of the equality of 
general functions for the results illustrated above for LHS and RHS. We first define the 
functions: 
   lhs=:*/@(+"1) 
   rhs=:+/@(f*g)      g=:*/"1@(]^T)@]      f=:*/"1@(]^0&=@T)@[        T=: #:@i.@(2&^)@# 
For lists V and W of one element each, the results of V lhs W  and V rhs W  can easily 
be shown to be equiva lent. We now present an inductive  proof in which we assume that 
V lhs W  and V rhs W  are equivalent for any lists of n elements, and then use that 
induction hypothesis  to prove that they are equivalent for lists on n+1 elements. Thus: 
(x,V) rhs (y,W) 
+/(x,V) (f*g) (y,W) Def of rhs 
+/(L=:(x,V)f(y,W))*(x,V)g(y,W) Def of fork

Logic 
A. Domain and Range 
As stated in Section 1 D, the domain of a verb is the collection of arguments to which it 
can apply. For example, the integer 4 is in the domain of >:, but the characters '!' and 
'b'  and '4' are not. 
Similarly, the range  of a verb is the collection of r esults that it can produce. The verb >: 
can produce any integer, and so its range is  the same as its domain. This agreement of 
range and domain also holds for verbs such as + and *; but not for %, which can produce 
fractions  or rational numbers , and so has a wider range as discussed in Chapter 9. 
A verb may also have a range more limited than its domain. For example, the verb 4&| 
applies to any integer, but its results all fall in the finite list i.4, that is,0 1 2 3 . 
It is sometimes useful to examine the proper ties of a verb when it is applied only to a 
restricted part of its domain, particularly if it is restricted to its range. For example, when restricted to the domain 
i.4, the verbs: 
 
 pm4=: 4&|@*  (Product modulo 4) 
 sm4=: 4&|@+  (Sum modulo 4) 
 
have the following tables: 
 
   pm4/~ i.4 sm4/~ i.4 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 1 2 3 0 0 2 0 2 2 3 0 1 0 3 2 1 3 0 1 2  
We will use the phrase “ v on d” to refer to the verb resulting from restricting the verb v 
to the domain d. For example, “ 4&|@*  on i.4” refers to the product mod 4 restricted to 
the domain 0 1 2 3 , and “* on i.2” refers to the boolean and, to be discussed in 
Section C. 
58  Arithmetic 
 
B. Propositions 
A proposition  or truth-function  is any statement which can be judged to be either true or 
false, and is therefore a verb having a range of two elements. Following Boole (the father 
of symbolic logic), we will denote these elements by 1 (for true) and 0 (for false). For 
example: 
 
   p=: <&5    p 3 1     p a=:i.8 (p a)#a 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4     2=+/0=|/~ a 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1     a#~2=+/0=|/~ a 2 3 5 7 
C. Booleans 
The nouns 0 and 1 (the range of propositions) are called booleans , and a verb whose 
domain and range are boolean is called a boolean function , or boolean . For example, * 
limited to booleans might be called and; its table would appear as follows: 
   and=:* 
   and/~ b=:0 1 0 0 0 1     ]c=:i.8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7     (>&2 c) and (<&5 c) 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0     (>&2 and <&5) c 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0     c #~ (>&2 and <&5) c 3 4    (] #~ >&2 and <&5) c 3 4  
The sentence (>&2 and <&5)  is a “compound” proposition whose result is true if the 
proposition >&2 is true and the proposition <&5 is true. 
A verb or may be defined similarly: 
 
   or=: *@+    or/~b 0 1 
Chapter 6  Logic  59 
  
1 1 
    (=&7 c) or (<&5 c) 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1  
Note that the dyad + may produce non-boolean results, from which the monad * (called 
signum ) produces booleans. Thus:  
 
   * _2 0 2 +/~ b * +/~b 
_1 0 1 0 1 0 1   1 2 1 1 
The booleans and and or are exceedingly useful. For example: 
 
   dof10=: 0&=@(|&10)    dof10 c =: 1+i. 20  1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0     c#~dof10 c

60  Arithmetic 
 
The dyad +. is defined to yield the greatest common divisor of its arguments: 
 
   10 +. 15 +./ 10 15 5 5  
The least common multiple is denoted by *. as illustrated below:  
 
   10 *. 15 (10*15) % 10+.15 30 30 
D. Primitives 
Verbs (such as * and + and *. and i.) that are denoted by single words are called 
primitives , to distinguish them from derived  verbs produced by phrases such as that ( *@+) 
used to define the boolean or in Section C. Since primitives and derived verbs are treated 
identically, this distinction is of little con sequence except to the designer of a language, 
who must choose what primitives to provide. 
Should new primitives be added for such important cases as the boolean and and or? Not 
if primitives already exist that give the appropr iate results when restricted to the boolean 
domain. The dyads <. and >. (min and max) might be tested for this purpose. Thus: 
   and=: * 
   or=: *@+    b=: 0 1    <./~b >./~b 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1    and/~b or/~b 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1  
But do min and max provide the appropriate identity elements? The identity element for 
or should be 0, and for and should be 1, as illustrated below:  
 
   0 or b 1 and b 0 1 0 1  
However, the identity elements of min and max are infinities. Thus: 
    <./i.0 >./i.0 _ __  
Other candidates for or and and when restricted to booleans are the greatest common 
divisor (+.) and the least common multiple ( *.) introduced in the preceding section. 
Thus: 
 
   +./~b *./~b 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1  
Chapter 6  Logic  61 
  
   +./i.0 *./i.0 
0 1 
Hereafter, these primitives will be used for or and and. It may be noted that Boole also 
represented or and and by then-current symbols for plus and times , but without the 
appended dot used here to distinguish them from these verbs. 
E. Boolean Dyads 
Are there any other boolean dyads in addition to *. and +. (and and or)? If so, how 
many? 
To answer these questions we first display the tables for *. and +., together with the 
ravel  of each produced by the monad , : 
 
   *./~ b=:0 1 +./~ b=:0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1     ,*./~b ,+./~b 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1  
We then observe that each table must contain four elements, each of which must belong 
to the range 0 1. Since each element may have either of two values, there are 2*2*2*2 , 
or 2^4, or 16 possible tables which, when ravelled to form a four-element list, must agree 
with one of the columns in the following transposed table: 
 
   |:T 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1  
For example, columns 1 and 7 represent *. and +. : 
    1{"1 T 7{"1 T 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1     and=: 1 b. or=: 7 b.    and/~ 0 1 or/~ 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1     and/i. 0 or/i. 0 1 0  
As illustrated in the foregoing, the adverb b. applies to any of the indices ( 0 to 15) of the 
table T to produce the corresponding boolean dyad. It may be noted that the base-2 value 
of any row yields its index; for example, 2#.7{T  is 7. 
62  Arithmetic 
 
F. Boolean Monads 
A monad that negates a boolean argument is equivalent to subtraction from 1; it is called 
not, and is denoted by -. . There are in all four boolean monads as illustrated below: 
 
   b 0 1     -. b 1 0     ] b 
0 1     ~:~ b 
0 0 
    =~ b 
1 1 
G. Generators 
In English, compound propositions are commonly expressed using only or, and, and not. 
For example, using p, q, and r to denote propositions, and using parentheses to express 
the punctuation clearly: 
 
 p and q (1 b. ) 
 not (p and q) (14 b. ) 
 (p or q) and not (p and q) (6 b. ) Exclusive-or  
 not p and (not q) (13 b. ) Implication 
 (p or q) or (p or not q) (15 b. )    True 
 (p and q) and (p and not q) (0 b. ) False 
 
Each of the foregoing phrases can be restated as definitions of verbs.  For example: 
 
   exclor=: +. *. -.@*.    exclor/~ 0 1 0 1 1 0  
Can all of the sixteen booleans be expressed using only or, and, and not ? The answer is 
yes, and for this reason the collection of verbs +. *. -.  is said to be a set of generators  
of the booleans. For example, the case 0 b.  (which yields 0 for every pair of arguments) 
can be expressed as (p and q) and (p and not q) , and 15 b.  as not 
(p and q) and (p and not q) . 
Chapter 6  Logic  63 
  
Is +. *. -.  a minimal set of generators, or could one of them be omitted? This is easily 
answered by showing that *. itself can be expressed in terms of +. and -. and can 
therefore be omitted: 
 and is not (not p) or (not q) 
The foregoing relation is sometimes expressed as “ and is the dual of or (with respect to 
negation).” 
The use of or and not as the only generators can lead to cumbersome expressions for 
some of the booleans, but all can be expressed in terms of them. 
Can a single boolean serve as generator? It can be shown that either 8 b.  (not-or  or nor) 
or 14 b.  (not-and  or nand ) will serve. This matter is developed in exercises. 
H. Boolean Primitives 
The primitives +. and *. (gcd and lcm) when restricted to the boolean domain provide 
the important boolean verbs or and and. Others are provided by similarly restricting 
relations: 
 
 < 4 b. 
 <: 13 b. Implication  
 = 9 b. Identity 
 >: 11 b.  > 2 b. 
 ~: 6 b. 
Exclusive-or 
 
Finally, +: and *: denote nor and nand , that is, 8 b.  and 14 b.  . 
I. Summary of Notation 
The notation introduced in this chapter comprises one adverb boolean  (b.); five dyads 
or, and, nor, nand ,  and not-equal  (+. *. +: *: ~: ); three monads not, signum , and 
ravel  (-. * , ).

Permutations 
A. Introduction 
Permute  is a verb meaning “to change the order of”, and |. is an example of a 
permutation: 
 
   |. 'abcdef' fedcba     |. i. 5 4 3 2 1 0  
Indexing provides arbitrary permutations. For example:  
 
   2 0 1 5 4 3 { 'abcdef' cabfed  
A list of indices to { that produces a permutation is called a permutation vector , or 
permutation , and one that contains n elements is called a permutation of order n. A 
permutation of order n is itself a permutation of the list i. n . 
 
To enumerate all permutations of order n, it is best to list them in ascending order 
(ascending when considered as the digits re presenting an integer), as illustrated in the 
following tables:  
 
   p3 p2 0 1 2 0 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 p1 2 0 1 0 2 1 0     i=:i.!3 
 
66  Arithmetic 
 
 
   i{p4         (6+i){p4      (12+i){p4      (18+i){p4 0 1 2 3      1 0 2 3       2 0 1 3        3 0 1 2 0 1 3 2      1 0 3 2       2 0 3 1        3 0 2 1 0 2 1 3      1 0 3 2       2 1 0 3        3 1 0 2 0 2 3 1      1 2 3 0       2 1 3 0        3 1 2 0 0 3 1 2      1 3 0 2       2 3 0 1        3 2 0 1 0 3 2 1      1 3 2 0       2 3 1 0        3 2 1 0  
A row (or rows) of any one of these tables can  be applied to index (and therefore to 
permute) a list of the appropriate number of items. For example: 
 
   3{p4 0 2 3 1     (3{p4){'abcd' acdb     (3 4{p4){'abcd' acdb adbc     (3 4{p4){i.4 0 2 3 1 0 3 1 2     p3{'abc' p2{'ab' abc ab acb ba bac bca cab cba     3 A. 'abcd' acdb     3 4 A. 'abcd' acdb adbc  
The last examples illustrate the use of the dyad A. in which i A. y  permutes y by a 
permutation of order #y, the permutation being row i of the corresponding table of all 
permutations of that order. 
The index i in the phrase i A. y  can be thought of as an atomic  (that is, single-element) 
representation of the permutation vector it applies, thus providing a mnemonic for the 
word A. . 
From these examples it should be clear that the phrase (i.!n)A.i.n  will produce the 
complete table of !n permutations of order n. Thus: 
 
Chapter 7 Permutations  67 
  
   PT=: i.@! A. i. 
    PT 3 PT 2 PT 1 0 1 2 0 1 0 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 1 2 1 0 
B. Arrangements 
Any selection of k different items from a list is called an arrangement , or k-arrangement . 
For example, 0 1{a  and 1 0{a  and 3 1{a  are 2-arrangements from the list 
a=:'abcd' . 
Any k columns of a permutation table will contain all k-arrangements, each arrangement 
appearing !k times. For example:  
 
   ALL=: (PT #a) { a=:'abcd'    AR2=: 2 {."1 ALL    CLAR2=: ~. AR2    ALL AR2     CLAR2 abcd ab ab abdc ab ac acbd ac ad acdb ac ba adbc ad bc adcb ad bd bacd ba ca badc ba cb bcad bc cd bcda bc da bdac bd db bdca bd dc cabd ca cadb ca cbad cb cbda cb cdab cd cdba cd dabc da dacb da dbac db dbca db dcab dc dcba dc  
The table ALL contains all permutations of the list a; the table AR2 contains all 2-
arrangements, with each arrangement appearing twice; the table CLAR2  is the “clean” 
table of arrangements with redundant ite ms suppressed. The suppression of redundant 
items is performed by the monad ~. (called nub).    
68  Arithmetic 
 
C. Combinations 
The arrangement 'ca'  that occurs in the table CLAR2  is a permutation of the arrangement 
'ac' , and the two cases therefore represent the same combination of elements from the 
list a=: 'abcd' . We may obtain a table of all 2-combinations of a by first sorting each 
row of CLAR2 , and then taking the nub of the sorted table: 
 
   /:~"1 CLAR2 ~./:~"1 CLAR2 ab ab ac ac ad ad ab bc bc bd bd cd ac bc cd ad bd cd  
The steps in the development of combinati ons can now be assembled to define a verb C 
such that k C n  produces the table of all k-combinations of order n: 
 
   nub=: ~.    rtake=: {."1    rsort=: /:~"1    C=: nub@rsort@nub@([ rtake (PT@]))    2 C 4 (2 C #a){a=: 'abcd' 0 1 ab 0 2 ac 0 3 ad 1 2 bc 1 3 bd 2 3 cd     1 C 3 2 C 3 3 C 3 0 0 1 0 1 2 1 0 2 2 1 2     2 C 5 3 C 5 0 1 0 1 2 0 2 0 1 3 0 3 0 1 4 0 4 0 2 3 1 2 0 2 4 1 3 0 3 4 1 4 1 2 3 2 3 1 2 4 2 4 1 3 4 
Chapter 7 Permutations  69 
  
3 4 2 3 4 
    $ 2 C 5 $ 3 C 5 10 2 10 3     (!5)%(!2)*(!5-2)    (!5)%(!3)*(!5-3) 10 10  
The foregoing definition of C shows clearly the relation of combinations to the 
permutations of the corresponding order. However, it is highly inefficient in the sense 
that k C n  generates and sorts a large table (of r=:!n  rows and n columns) in order to 
select from it a smaller table (of r%(!k)*(!n-k)  rows and k columns). A more efficient 
alternative is developed in Exercise J10 of Chapter 9. 
As illustrated by the preceding examples, the number of k-combinations of order n is 
given by (!n)%(!k)*(!n-k) . The number of combinations is a commonly-useful 
result; so important that the corresponding verb  is treated as a primitive. For example: 
 
   2!5 (i.6)!5 10 1 5 10 10 5 1     !/~i.6 1 1 1 1 1  1 0 1 2 3 4  5 0 0 1 3 6 10 0 0 0 1 4 10 0 0 0 0 1  5 0 0 0 0 0  1  
The last result is called the table of binomial coefficients ; when transposed and displayed 
without the relevant sub-dia gonal zeros it is also called Pascal’s triangle . 
D. Products of Permutations 
If p is a permutation vector, then the verb p&{ is a permutation. For example:  
 
   p=: 2 3 4 1 0 5    P=:p&{    P a=:'abcdef' P P a cdebaf ebadcf     P^:2 a ebadcf     P^:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 a P^:(i.9) i.6 abcdef 0 1 2 3 4 5 cdebaf 2 3 4 1 0 5 ebadcf 4 1 0 3 2 5 adcbef 0 3 2 1 4 5 cbedaf 2 1 4 3 0 5 edabcf 4 3 0 1 2 5 
70  Arithmetic 
 
abcdef 0 1 2 3 4 5 
cdebaf 2 3 4 1 0 5 ebadcf 4 1 0 3 2 5  
In the foregoing it may be noted that the sixth power of the permutation P agrees with its 
original argument, and the pattern therefore repeats thereafter. The period  of this 
particular permutation is therefore said to be 6. 
E. Cycles 
Column 3 of the tables produced by the power of the permutation P of Section D shows 
that position 3 of successive powers is occupied by the elements 'd', and 'b' (or 3 1) 
in a repeating cycle of length two. Column 1 shows the same cycle displaced. 
Similarly, column 4 shows the length- 3 cycle 4 0 2 , and columns 0 and 2 show the 
same cycle displaced; column 5 shows the 1-cycle 5.  
The permutation P could therefore be represented unambiguously by its cycles  as follows: 
   c=: 3 1 ; 4 0 2 ; 5 
   c 
+---+-----+-+ 
|3 1|4 0 2|5| +---+-----+-+ 
The dyad C. produces permutations specified in cycle form. Thus: 
   c C. a=:'abcdef' 
cdebaf     p { a cdebaf     p C. a cdebaf  
As illustrated by the last example, the dyad C. also accepts permutation vectors as the 
left argument, and in that case is equivalent to the dyad { . Finally, the monad  C. 
provides a self-inverse transformation between the cycle and permutation-vector 
representations of a permutation. Thus:  
   C. c 
2 3 4 1 0 5    C. C. c 
+---+-----+-+ 
|3 1|4 0 2|5| +---+-----+-+ 
   PT=: i.@! A. i.    
   (PT 3);(C. PT 3);(C. C. PT 3) 
+-----+-------------+-----+ 
|     |+-----+---+-+|     | |     ||  0  | 1 |2||     | |     |+-----+---+-+|     | |0 1 2||  0  |2 1| ||0 1 2| |0 2 1|+-----+---+-+|0 2 1| |1 0 2|| 1 0 | 2 | ||1 0 2| |1 2 0|+-----+---+-+|1 2 0| 
Chapter 7 Permutations  71 
  
|2 0 1||2 0 1|   | ||2 0 1| 
|2 1 0|+-----+---+-+|2 1 0| |     ||2 1 0|   | ||     | |     |+-----+---+-+|     | |     ||  1  |2 0| ||     | |     |+-----+---+-+|     | +-----+-------------+-----+ 
From columns 0 and 1 of the table of Section D it may be seen that the return to an 
identity permutation can occur only when the two cycles (of lengths 2 and 3) complete at 
the same time, in this case after 2*3 applications of the permutation. The period of the 
permutation is therefore 6. 
In general, the period of a permutation is th e least common multiple of the lengths of its 
cycles. This will be illustrated further by a permutation of order 20 :

There are exactly !n permutations of order n, and the “factorial” base n-i.n  introduced 
in Section 4 E can be seen to provide exactly !n distinct lists of n integers, each 
belonging to i.n: 
   R=: (]-i.) #: i.@! 
   R 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 
72  Arithmetic 
 
1 0 0 
1 1 0 2 0 0 2 1 0  
These lists can be used to represent the permutations in what we will call a reduced 
representation, as distinguished from the “direct” representation used thus far: 
 
   D=: i.@! A. i.    D 3 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 1 2 1 0  
We will now define a verb RFD to yield the reduced representation from the direct, and an 
inverse DFR: 
 
   RFD=: +/@({.>}.)\."1    DFR=: /:^:2@,/"1  
For example:  
 
   RFD D 3 DFR R 3 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 0 0 2 1 1 0 0 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 1 2 1 0 2 1 0 
 
The definitions of these verbs will be discussed in exercises.

Classification and Sets 
A. Introduction 
It is often necessary to separate a collecti on of objects into several classes, and then 
perform some operation upon each of the classes. The operation performed is often trivial compared to the complexity of the classifi cation procedure itself, and classification is 
therefore an important matter. Indeed, most computation involves some classification, even though the classification process may be implicit rather than explicit. 
As an example of the use of classification, cons ider a set of transactions that are recorded 
as a list of account numbers and a correspondi ng list of credits to the accounts. Thus: 
 
   an=: 1010 1040 1030 1030 1020 1010 1040 1040 1050    cr=:  131  755  458  532  218   47  678  679  934  
A summary should therefore post the sum 131+47  to account 1010   and 218 to account 
1020 , and so on. If:  
 
   all=: 1010 1020 1030 1040 1050  
is the list of all account numbers, then c=: all =/ an is the classification table, and:  
 
   c=: all =/ an    c 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1    c*cr 131   0   0   0   0 47   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 218  0   0   0   0   0   0 458 532   0  0   0   0   0   0 755   0   0   0  0 678 679   0   0   0   0   0   0  0   0   0 934     +/"1 c*cr 
76  Arithmetic 
 
178 218 990 2112 934 
The classification represented by the table c is both complete  (each element being 
assigned to some class) and disjoint  (each element being assigned to no more than one 
class). Classifications that arise from the expression a =/ b  are disjoint if the elements 
of a are all distinct, and are complete if every element of b belongs to a. A boolean table 
B represents a complete disjoint classification if and only if each of its column sums is 
equal to 1; that is, if *./1=+/B  . 
Since a table provides such a convenient representation of a classification, we will 
henceforth speak (rather loosely) of th e table itself as a classification, or as an n-way  
classification, where n=:#B . 
Meaningful classifications need not be disjoint. For example, the letters of the alphabet 
may be classified phonetically by a 27-column table as follows: 
 
   a=:'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz '    PH 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0  
   (0{PH)#a 
Sibilants

bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz  
   a#~ >/4 2{PH 
Consonants that are not plosives  
cfghjklmnqrsvwxz  
 
Moreover, if t is any text, then (a i. t){"1 PH  provides classifications of it:  
 
   t=: 'i sing of olaf'    a i. t 8 26 18 8 13 6 26 14 5 26 14 11 0 5 
    (a i. t) {"1 PH

Chapter 8 Classification And Sets  77 
  
 
iiooa  sngflf 
Incomplete classifications are also useful. For example, the classification provided by PH 
is incomplete because the space belongs to none of the classes. Indeed, every n-way 
classification B implicitly defines a further class (which might be called other ) defined by 
the expression -.+./B ; that is, not the or over the classes. Any classification table may 
therefore be completed by applying the verb comp=: ] , -.@(+./)  . 
Related classifications can be obtained from a table. Thus: 
 
   ]M=:>1 0 0 1 0;0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0    M *."0 1 PH 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0     sovfop=: +./"2 M *."0 1 PH    sovfop 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0     ((a i. t) {"1 sovfop) # t isiooa ff      
The first  row of the resulting classification table sovfop  includes sibilants or vowels; 
the second includes fricatives or plosives. 
For any classification table B, a corresponding disjoint classification can be obtained by 
suppressing from each column any 1 except the first. This is achieved by the expression 
</\B . For example: 
 
   </\PH 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 
78  Arithmetic 
 
The last class of the resulting table represents “all consonants that do not fall in the earlier 
classes”. 
B. Sets 
A set is a one-way classification, and is therefore defined by a proposition. For example: 
   GT10=: >&10 VOW=: +./@('aeiouy'&(=/)) 
   L=: 2 3 5 7    MEML=: +./@(L&(=/)) III=: (]=<.) *. >&8 *. <&75      GT10 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 0 0 0 0 1 1 1     VOW 'happy those early days' 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0     MEML i.15 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0      III 6 7 +/ 2%~i.10 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 
Thus, VOW defines “The set of all vowels”, MEML  defines “The set of all members of the 
list L (a parameter that may be changed) ”, and III defines “The set of all integers in an 
interval”. 
The proposition that defines a set is often itself defined in terms of the list of elements 
that belong to the set, as was done directly in the proposition VOW, and indirectly in the 
proposition MEML .  
Although we often speak loosely of the set as the list itself (as in “The set 'aeiouy' ”, or 
“The set L”), it is important to remember that the definition of the set is the entire  
proposition , that the ordering of the elements of the list therefore imposes no ordering on 
the members of the set, and that the repetition of elements in the defining list does not affect the definition of the set. 
A set is completely determined by the proposition that defines it, and we will sometimes 
speak loosely of “the set 
P” rather than “the set defined by P”. The defining proposition is 
often compound, and these compound propositions are often given special names. Thus: 
   PI=: P1 *. P2     The intersection  of P1 and P2 
   PU=: P1 +. P2     The union  of P1 and P2 
   PD=: P1 >  P2     The difference  of P1 and P2 
  PSD=: P1 ~: P2     The symmetric difference  of P1 and P2 
Although a proposition defining a set may have an  infinite domain (such as all numbers), 
it is also useful to consider propositions rest ricted to a finite list of arguments. We will 
denote such lists by names beginning with U (for universe of discourse ). 
For example, some or all of the letters of the alphabet might be assigned to colours, as in 
Acquamarine, Blue, Cyan, Dun, ... Orange, Pink,  Quercitron, Red, ... Yellow, and Zaffer. 
The universe is then defined by: 
 
Chapter 8 Classification And Sets  79 
  
   U=:'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' 
 
and the sets of primary and secondary pigment colours might be defined by the 
propositions: 
 
   P=: +./@(1 17 24&(=/)@(U&i.))    S=: +./@(6 14 21&(=/)@(U&i.)) 
For example: 
    (P U)#U U#~S U BRY GOV     cv=: P U    cv 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0     ]ml=: cv # U BRY  
The vectors cv and ml defined above are the characteristic vector  and member list  of the 
set defined by the  proposition P on the universe U. The set P could alternatively be 
defined in terms of them: 
 
   P1=: {&cv@(U&i.) 
   P2=: +./@(ml&(=/))    U#~P1 U U#~P2 U BRY BRY  
The table B=: #: i. 2^# U  (whose rows are the base- 2 representations of successive 
integers) provides an exhaustive  classification of the universe U, including the empty  set 
(represented by a characteristic vector of zeros ), and the complete set (represented by a 
characteristic vector of ones). For example: 
 
   ]EC=: #: i. 2^# U=: 2 3 5 
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1  
This exhaustive classification is very useful. For example, the sums and products over all 
subsets of U can be obtained as follows: 
 
   +/"1 U*EC */"1 U^EC 
0 5 3 8 2 7 5 10 1 5 3 15 2 10 6 30 
Moreover, since EC is exhaustive, any collection of subsets can be obtained by selecting 
rows from it. For example: 
80  Arithmetic 
 
 
   5 1 2{EC (2=+/"1 EC)#EC 
1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 
0 1 0 1 1 0 
C. Nub Classification 
The nub of an argument contains all of its distinct items. Thus: 
 
   nub=: ~. text=: 'mississippi'    nub    ]i=:nub i. text          i{nub misp 0 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 mississippi  
A classification of an argument in terms of its nub will be called a nub or self or auto 
classification. For example: 
 
   nub =/ text = text 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0    +/"1 = text 1 4 4 2  
The table on the right shows the use of the nub-classification monad = ; the expression 
+/"1 = text  gives the distribution  of the items of its argument, that is, a frequency 
count of its distinct items. 
D. Interval Classification 
A list of integers L may be classified according to its interval , that is, the list of 
successive integers beginning with the largest element of L and continuing through the 
smallest. Thus: 
   (INT=: >./ - i.@>:@(>./ - <./)) L=:8 3 0 _1 0 3 8 
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 _1    (INT L) =/ L ' *' {~ (INT L) =/ L 1 0 0 0 0 0 1             *     * 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0              *   * 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0               * * 0 0 0 1 0 0 0                *     
If the list L is the result of some function, then the foregoing classification is called a 
graph  of the function. For example, if: 
Chapter 8 Classification And Sets  81 
  
 
    PARABOLA=: -&2 * -&4  
then PARABOLA i. 7  yields the list L used above. The foregoing results can be collected 
to define a graphing function as follows: 
 
   GRAPH=: ] =/~ >./ - i.@>:@(>./ - <./)  
Moreover, the expression +./\GRAPH L  produces a barchart  of L. Conversely, (in the 
case of non-integer values of L) it may be better to define a barchart function directly by 
substituting the comparison <:/ for the =/ used in GRAPH : 
 
   BARCHART=: ] <:/~ >./ - i.@>:@(>./ - <./)  
A graph may then be provided by the expression </\ BARCHART L . Finally, it may be 
remarked that a barchart is a classification  of its argument, and that the phrase </\ 
applied to it produces the corresponding disjoint  classification used as a graph. 
E. Membership Classification 
The functions VOW and MEML  of Section B provide examples of defining a classification 
according to membership in a list, using an or over equality , as in MEML=: 
+./@(L&(=/))  . Membership in a list is important enough to be accorded a primitive, 
denoted in mathematics by the Greek letter epsilon , and here by e. . For example, the 
function MEML  could be defined by e.&L  . 
Membership can be used to define a form of plotting  that supplements the barcharts and 
graphs provided by the interval classification in Section D. If B is a boolean table, then 
B{' *'  gives a plot of the points indicated by the ones in B: 
 
   B B{' *' 1 1 1 0 0 0 *** 1 0 1 0 0 0 * * 1 0 1 0 0 0 * * 
1 1 1 0 0 0 ***
 
 
Such a table can be specified by the coordinates of its ones; for example, the coordinates 
defining B are the columns of the table: 
 
   b=:0 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 1 2,:0 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 3  
Laminate  (,:) forms a table from list arguments: 
 
   b 0 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 3  
If A is a table of all coordinates of B, then B itself can be specified in terms of the index 
list b by using membership ( e.) in the expression A e. boxcol b , where boxcol  
82  Arithmetic 
 
boxes the columns of its argument. We first de fine a function to generate all indices of a 
table, using the catalogue  function { that forms boxed lists by choosing an element from 
each of the boxes in its argument: 
 
   ]w=:'ABC';'abcd' 
+---+----+ 
|ABC|abcd| +---+----+ 
 
   {w 
+--+--+--+--+ 
|Aa|Ab|Ac|Ad| +--+--+--+--+ |Ba|Bb|Bc|Bd| +--+--+--+--+ |Ca|Cb|Cc|Cd| +--+--+--+--+     (i.&.>"1)  4 6 
+-------+-----------+ 
|0 1 2 3|0 1 2 3 4 5| +-------+-----------+ 
 
   ALLIX=: {@(i.&.>"1) 
   ALLIX 4 6  
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
|0 0|0 1|0 2|0 3|0 4|0 5| +---+---+---+---+---+---+ |1 0|1 1|1 2|1 3|1 4|1 5| +---+---+---+---+---+---+ |2 0|2 1|2 2|2 3|2 4|2 5| +---+---+---+---+---+---+ |3 0|3 1|3 2|3 3|3 4|3 5| +---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
 
We now use ALLIX  to form the lists of coordinates  in the usual form; that is, with the x-
coordinate first and increasing from left to right, and with the y-coordinate increasing 
from bottom to top:  
 
   ALLCO=: |.&.>@:|.@:ALLIX@:>:    ALLCO 4 6 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ |0 4|1 4|2 4|3 4|4 4|5 4|6 4| +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ |0 3|1 3|2 3|3 3|4 3|5 3|6 3| +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ |0 2|1 2|2 2|3 2|4 2|5 2|6 2| +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ |0 1|1 1|2 1|3 1|4 1|5 1|6 1| +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ |0 0|1 0|2 0|3 0|4 0|5 0|6 0| +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+      plot=: {&' *'@(ALLCO@[ e. boxcol@])       boxcol=: <"1@|: 
 
   4 6 plot b 
Chapter 8 Classification And Sets  83 
  
        
***     * *     * *     *** 
 
A function equivalent to plot  can also be defined by replacing all of its component 
functions by the expressions that define them:  
 
  PLOT=:{&' *'@(|.&.>@|.@({@(i.&.>"1))@>:@[e.<"1@|:@])      
If f and g are two functions, then a plot of the points with x-coordinate f k{a  and y-
coordinate g k{a  will be called a plot of f with g or, alternatively,  a plot of g versus  f.

Polynomials 
A. Introduction 
A polynomial is a weighted sum of non-nega tive integer powers of its argument. For 
example: 
 
   x=:1 2 3 4 5    e=: 0 1 2 3    c=: 1 3 3 1    x^/e c*x^/e 1 1  1   1 1  3  3   1 1 2  4   8 1  6 12   8 1 3  9  27 1  9 27  27 1 4 16  64 1 12 48  64 1 5 25 125 1 15 75 125     +/"1 c*x^/e 8 27 64 125 216  
The final result is the value of a polynomial with exponents  e and weights (or 
coefficients ) c applied to an argument list x. 
A zero coefficient effectively suppresses the effect of the corresponding exponent (e.g., 
+/"1 (0 0 1 2)*x^/0 1 2 3  is equivalent to +/"1 (1 2)*x^/2 3  ); it is therefore 
convenient to express a polynomial only in terms of its coefficients c, and to assume that 
the corresponding exponents are i.#c  : 
 
   POL=: +/"1 @ ([ * ] ^/ i.@#@[)    c POL x 8 27 64 125 216  
The discussion in Sections A-D will be limited to polynomials with integer coefficients, 
but general polynomials admit real and co mplex numbers, as discussed in Section F. 
Because a general polynomial admits an arbitrary number of arbitrary coefficients, polynomials can be designed to approximate almost any function of practical interest. 
86  Arithmetic 
 
Although its utility rests largely on its potential for approximation, the polynomial has 
other important characteristics that can be discu ssed in the restricted context of integers: 
the following four functions are themselves polynomials: 
1. The sum or difference of polynomials. 2. The product of polynomials. 3. The derivative (or “rate of change”) of a polynomial. 4. The integral of (or “area under”) a polynomial. 
Although the coefficients of the polynomials for cases 3 and 4 are trivial to compute 
(
}.c*i.#c  and 0,c%>:i.#c ), their treatment will be deferred to Section H. 
B. Sums and Products 
The cases of the sum and product may be illustrated as follows: 
   x=: 0 1 2 3 4 5 
   c=: 1 3 3 1 d=: 1 2 1    c POL x 1 8 27 64 125 216     d POL x 1 4 9 16 25 36     (c POL x) + (d POL x) 2 12 36 80 150 252     (c+d,0) POL x 2 12 36 80 150 252     (c POL x) * (d POL x) 1 32 243 1024 3125 7776     TIMES=: +//. @ (*/)    c TIMES d 1 5 10 10 5 1     (c TIMES d) POL x 1 32 243 1024 3125 7776  
It will be more illuminating to discuss the su m and product of polynomials in terms of a 
table of an arbitrary number of coefficients. For example: 
 
   ]TC=: >1 3 3 1 ; 1 2 1 ; 1 1 1 3 3 1 1 2 1 0 1 1 0 0     +/TC 3 6 4 1    (+/TC) POL x 
Chapter 9 Polynomials  87 
  
3 14 39 84 155 258 
    TIMES/TC 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 0 0 0     (TIMES/TC) POL x 1 64 729 4096 15625 46656     TC POL"1 x */TC POL"1 x 1 8 27 64 125 216 1 64 729 4096 15625 46656 1 4  9 16  25  36 1 2  3  4   5   6 
It should be noted that the final zeros appe nded to coefficients in forming the table TC do 
not change their effects as coefficients. Howe ver, it may be convenient to trim redundant 
trailing zeros from a result such as TIMES/TC  above. Thus: 
   trim=: +./\.@* # ] 
   trim TIMES/TC (i.7)!6 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 
C. Roots 
If a function f applied to an argument a yields 0, then a is said to be a zero or root of f. 
A function is sometimes defined in terms of its roots. For example: 
 
   PIR=: */@(-~/)    r=: 2 3 5    x=: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6    r PIR x (x-2)*(x-3)*(x-5) _30 _8 0 0 _2 0 12 _30 _8 0 0 _2 0 12     r&PIR x _30 _8 0 0 _2 0 12  
The monad r&PIR  is also said to be a polynomial (or polynomial in terms of roots) 
because it can be shown to be equivalent to a polynomial c&POL  for appropriate 
coefficients c. This is best demonstrated by defining a function CFR that produces the 
coefficients from the roots. Thus: 
 
   AS=: #:@i.@(2&^)@# 
   AS r Boolean table of all subsets of #r items. 
0 0 0 
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 
    POAS=: */"1@(-^AS) 
   POAS r 
Product over all subsets of -r. 
1 _5 _3 15 _2 10 6 _30 
 
88  Arithmetic 
 
   CLBN=: =@(+/"1@AS) Classification by number of  
   CLBN r elements in set.  
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
 
   CFR=: +/"1@|.@(CLBN*POAS)    
Coefficients from roots.  
   CFR r 
_30 31 _10 1 
    (CFR r) POL x 
_30 _8 0 0 _2 0 12    r PIR x _30 _8 0 0 _2 0 12 
D. Expansion 
If the polynomial d&POL  is equivalent to c&POL x+1 , then the coefficients d are said to 
be the expansion  of the coefficients c. More formally, d is the expansion of c if d&POL  
and c&POL@>:  are equivalent. For example: 
   x=: i. 6 c=:3 1 4 2 
   ]d=: +/ c * !~/~i.#c 10 15 10 2     d POL x 10 37 96 199 358 585    c POL x+1 10 37 96 199 358 585     EXP=: +/@(] * !~/~@i.@#)    EXP c 10 15 10 2     EXP^:4 c 199 129 28 2     (EXP^:4 c) POL x 199 358 585 892 1291 1794     c POL x+4 199 358 585 892 1291 1794  
The definition of the function EXP will be analyzed in exercises. 
Although the function EXP and its non-negative powers can produce expansions for c 
POL x+i  for any non-negative integer i, it must be modified to handle the general case 
for fractional values of i such as 0.1. This matter will be addressed in Section F, after 
the introduction of real numbers. 
Chapter 9 Polynomials  89 
  
E. Graphs And Plots 
Graphs and barcharts of functions with non-integer results can be produced by the 
methods of Section 8 D.We first define a uniform grid of a specified number of intervals, and use it to classify the non-integer results. Thus: 
 
   space=:(>./ - <./)@] % [ 
   grid=: <./@] + space * i.@>:@[    graph=: {&' *'@ (</\@|.@ (grid </ ] + -:@space))    10 graph %: i. 40 
                                    **** 
                             *******                           *******                             *****                               *****                                ****                                  ***                                    **                                     **                                                                               *        
 
The plots of Section 8 E may be extended similarly:  
  GPLOT=: [ PLOT |.@([ classify"0 1 ]) 
  classify=: <:@(+/@(grid </ ] + -:@space))   PLOT=:{&' *'@(|.&.>@|.@({@(i.&.>"1))@>:@[e.<"1@|:@]) 
  6 10 GPLOT (*:,:+:) i.5 
          * 
                               *                     *      * *         
F. Real And Complex Numbers 
In order to discuss further uses of polynomials, it will be necessary to extend the domains 
of our primitives beyond the integers to whic h they have been restricted thus far. 
Just as the inverse of the successor  led to results outside of the counting numbers, so do 
inverses of certain functions on integers lead outside the domain of integers. For 
example: 
 
   a=: 1 2 3 4 
   *&2 ^:_1 a Rational numbers  
0.5 1 1.5 2 
    %&2 a 0.5 1 1.5 2 
90  Arithmetic 
 
 
   %&2 -a _0.5 _1 _1.5 _2  
   ^&2 ^:_1 a 
Irrational numbers  
1 1.41421 1.73205 2 
 
   %: a 
1 1.41421 1.73205 2 
 
   %: -a Imaginary numbers  
0j1 0j1.41421 0j1.73205 0j2 
 
   a+%:-a Complex numbers  
1j1 2j1.41421 3j1.73205 4j2 
 
The rationals include the integers and, toge ther with the irrationals, they comprise the 
real numbers. The informal extension of primitives to the real domain is straightforward; 
they are extended so as to maintain the prope rties discussed in Chapter 2. The imaginary 
and complex numbers are treated similarly, but merit further discussion. 
Since the square of any real number is non-negative, the square root of _1 must be a new 
number outside the domain of reals. It will be denoted by 0j1.  The product of 0j1 with 
any real number shares the property that its square is a negative number. This follows 
from the normal properties of multiplication: 
 
   b=: 1 2 3 4 5    b*0j1 0j1 0j2 0j3 0j4 0j5     (b*0j1) * (b*0j1) _1 _4 _9 _16 _25     b*b * 0j1*0j1 _1 _4 _9 _16 _25     (b*b) * (0j1 * 0j1)  _1 _4 _9 _16 _25     (b*b) * _1 _1 _4 _9 _16 _25 
If a and b and c and d are real numbers, then a+0j1*b  and c+0j1*d  are complex 
numbers. Moreover, their sum can be derived from the familiar properties of addition and 
multiplication: 
 
   a=: 1+b=: 1+c=: 1+d=: 1    a,b,c,d 4 3 2 1  
Chapter 9 Polynomials  91 
  
   (a+0j1*b) + (c+0j1*d) 
6j4     (a+c) + 0j1*(c+d) 6j3     (a+c) + 0j1*(b+d) 6+0j1*4 6j4 6j4  
The product of complex numbers can be derived similarly: 
    (a+0j1*b) * (c+0j1*d) 5j10     ((a*c)+(0j1*0j1*b*d)) + (0j1*((a*d)+(b*c)))  5j10     ((a*c)+(_1*b*d)) + (0j1*((a*d)+(b*c))) 5j10     ((a*c)-(b*d)) + (0j1*((a*d)+(b*c))) 5j10  
These processes can be described succinctly by representing each complex number by a 
two-element list, and using the primitive j. defined as follows: 
 
     j. y is 0j1*y    x j. y is x+j.y    j. b a j. b j./a,b 0j3 4j3 4j3 
The “complex plus” and “complex times” functions on two-element lists can now be 
defined as follows: 
 
   cplus=: +    ctimes=: -/@:* , +/@([ * |.@])    m=: 3 4 n=: 5 2    j./m j./n 3j4 5j2     ]sum=: m cplus n ]prod=: m ctimes n 8 6 7 26     j./prod (j./m)*(j./n) 7j26 7j26  
Although a collection of complex numbers coul d be represented by the rows of a two-
column table, it is more  convenient to adopt an atomic  representation, obtained by boxing 
each list. Thus: 
 
   M=:<m 
92  Arithmetic 
 
   N=:<n 
   M,N 
+---+---+ 
|3 4|5 2| +---+---+ 
   < (>M) ctimes (>N) +----+ 
|7 26| +----+ 
As illustrated above, the verb cplus  can be applied to these representations only by first 
applying > (open ), and the corresponding atomic repr esentation is obtained by applying 
the inverse < (box). 
The whole can be achieved by the conjunction &. in which the verb u &. v  first applies 
v, applies u to that, and finally applies v^:_1.  The conjunction &. is called under , 
because u is applied “under” v in the sense that surgery is performed under anaesthetic, 
the patient being restored from its effects at the end of the operation: 
   M ctimes&.> N 
+----+ 
|7 26| +----+ 
   M,N,M +---+---+---+ 
|3 4|5 2|3 4| +---+---+---+ 
   ctimes&.>/ M,N,M +-------+ 
|_83 106| +-------+ 
 
   CPLUS=: cplus&.>    CTIMES=: ctimes&.>    M CPLUS N CTIMES M 
+-----+ 
|10 30| +-----+ 
The monad magnitude  (|) is extended to complex numbers to  yield the square root of the 
sum of the squares of its imaginary parts: 
 
   | _5 5     | 3j4 5     %:+/*:3 4 5 
In other words, the magnitude is the dist ance of a point from the origin when the 
imaginary part is plotted against the real part. 
 
G. General Expansion 
Chapter 9 Polynomials  93 
  
The function EXP of Section D has the property that (EXP c) POL x  is equivalent to c 
POL x+1 . We will now define a more general expansion such that (y GEXP c) POL x  
is equivalent to c POL x+y : 
   x=: i. 6 
   y=: 0.1    c=: 3 1 4 2    GEXP=: +/@(] * !~/~@i.@#@] * [ ^ -/~@i.@#@])    y GEXP c 3.142 1.86 4.6 2     (y GEXP c) POL x 3.142 11.602 41.262 104.122 212.182 377.442    c POL x+y 3.142 11.602 41.262 104.122 212.182 377.442 
The definition of the expansion will be analyzed in exercises.  
H. Slopes And Derivatives 
If s is a small quantity, then the difference (f x+s)-(f x)  gives an indication of the 
change in the result of the function f in the vicinity of the point x. Moreover, the ratio 
s%~(f x+s)-(f x)  obtained by dividing the “step size” s into this difference gives an 
indication of the rate at which f is changing. Because on a graph of the function this ratio 
is the slope of the secant line joining the points with coordinates x,f x  and (x+s), f 
x+s, it is called the secant slope  of f. For example:  
   f=: *: The square function  
   x=: 4 [ s=: 2 
   (f x+s)-f x s%~(f x+s)-f x 20 10     ]s=: 10^-i.5 1 0.1 0.01 0.001 0.0001        s%~(f x+s)-f x 9 8.1 8.01 8.001 8.0001   
We now define a dyadic function F such that s F x  gives the secant slope of f at x with 
step size s: 
 
   F=: [ %~"0 1 f@([+/,@])-f@]    2 F x=: 4 5 6 7 10 12 14 16     s F x 
     9      11      13      15 
   8.1    10.1    12.1    14.1   8.01   10.01   12.01   14.01  8.001  10.001  12.001  14.001 8.0001 10.0001 12.0001 14.0001 
 
94  Arithmetic 
 
For a small step size, the secant slope s F x  is a close approximation to the slope of the 
tangent to the graph of f at the point x, a value called the derivative  of f at the point x. 
For example:  
 
   s=:10^_10 
   s F x Approximate derivative of square

    2*x 8 10 12 14    f=:^&3

   3*x^2 48 75 108 147     f=:^&4 
   s F x

256 500 864 1372 
 
   4*x^3

The foregoing results suggest that the derivative of ^&n is the function 
n&([ * ] ^ <:@[) . This relation will be explored by displaying the terms that must be 
summed to produce the results used in determining the slope, that is, f x+s  and f x and 
(f x+s)-f x  and s%~(f x+s)-f x . 
For the power function f=:^&n  and for the case n=: 3 , the terms of f x+s  are easily 
obtained from the direct expansion of the product (x+s)*(x+s)*(x+s)  to the form : 
 
   ((s^3)*(x^0)+(3*(s^2)*(x^1))+(3*(s^1)*(x^2))+((s^0)*(x^3))  Thus for x=:2 and s=:0.1:

In the general case of ^&n, the coefficients 1 3 3 1  and 0 0 0 1  become EXP CP n

It appears that the last two elements of the binomial coefficients of order n are n and 1. 
Since the binomial coefficients are the coefficients that represent the product (x+1)^n , 
insight can be gained by applying the product process of Section B to the corresponding 
coefficients 1 1:

I. Derivatives of Polynomials 
From the definition of the secant slope it is clear that the slope of a multiple of a function 
(m&*@f ) is the same multiple of its slope, and that the slope of the function f+g is the 
sum of the slopes of f and g. The same relations hold for derivatives.  
The polynomial c&POL  applied to an argument x is a sum of terms of the form 
(i{c)*(x^i)  and (using the results of Section H) its derivative is (i{c)*i*(x^i-1) . 
The derivative of the polynomial c&POL  is therefore a polynomial with coefficients 
}.c*i.#c . For example, using the functions F and POL of Sections H and A: 
 
   x=:1 2 3 4 5 c=:3 1 4 2    D=: }.@(] * i.@#)    D c (D c) POL x 1 8 6 15 41 79 129 191     f=:c&POL    (s=: 10^-10) F x 15 41 79 129 191 
J. The Exponential Family 
We will now examine coefficients of the form %!i.n , and their relation to the 
coefficients of the corresponding derivative polynomial: 
 
   ]ce=: %!i.n=: 7 1 1 0.5 0.166667 0.0416667 0.00833333 0.00138889     D ce 1 1 0.5 0.166667 0.0416667 0.00833333  
Except for the final coefficient, the function ce&POL  and its derivative 
(D ce)&POL  agree, and the agreement improves as n increases. 
The primitive monad ^ (called exponential ) is the limiting value of this polynomial. It is 
therefore a “growth” function, whose rate of growth is equal to the function itself. For 
example: 
 
   f=: ^    f x 2.71828 7.38906 20.0855 54.5982 148.413     s F x 
Chapter 9 Polynomials  97 
  
2.71828 7.38906 20.0855 54.5982 148.413 
 
Not only is the exponential important in its  own right, but the odd and even parts of ^ and 
^@j.  produce the hyperbolic functions ( sinh and cosh, denoted by 5&o.  and 6&o. ) and 
the circular  or trigonometric  functions ( sine and cosine , denoted by 1&o.  and 2&o. ). 
A function f is said to be symmetric  or even if it gives the same result for positive and 
negative arguments; that is, if f and f@- agree. In terms of its graph we may say that an 
even function is “reflected in the vertical axis”. A function f is skew-symmetric  or odd if f 
equals -@f@-  or, equivalently, if f equals f&.-  . Its graph is reflected in the origin. 
The functions: 
 
   e=: -:@(f+f@-)     o=: -:@(f-f@-)  
are, respectively, even and odd functions. Moreover, e+o equals f, and they are called 
the even and odd parts  of f. 
The adverbs  ..-  and .:- yield the even and odd parts of their arguments. For example: 
 
   cosh=: ^ ..-  space must precede .. 
   sinh=: ^ .:- 
   ]x=: 0.2*i.6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1     cosh x 1 1.02007 1.08107 1.18547 1.33743 1.54308     cosh -x 1 1.02007 1.08107 1.18547 1.33743 1.54308     sinh x 0 0.201336 0.410752 0.636654 0.888106 1.1752     sinh -x 0 _0.201336 _0.410752 _0.636654 _0.888106 _1.1752     5 o. x 0 0.201336 0.410752 0.636654 0.888106 1.1752     (sinh+cosh) x 1 1.2214 1.49182 1.82212 2.22554 2.71828     ^ x 1 1.2214 1.49182 1.82212 2.22554 2.71828 
 
The function ^@j.  and its odd and even parts yield fu rther important functions. We first 
observe that the magnitude of any result of ^@j.  is 1. Thus: 
 
   2 3 $ ^@j. x                 1 0.980067j0.198669 0.921061j0.389418 0.825336j0.564642 0.696707j0.717356 0.540302j0.841471  
98  Arithmetic 
 
   |^@j. x 
1 1 1 1 1 1 
As remarked in Section F, this implies that a plot of the imaginary part against the real 
part of any result of ^@j.  lies on a circle whose radius has a length of 1. Moreover, the 
even and odd parts of ^@j.  are its real and imaginary parts, and therefore the plot of one 
of the following functions against the other forms a circle: 
 
   cos=: ^@j. .. -     sin=: j^:_1@ (^@j. .:-)     26 52 GPLOT (sin,:cos) 0.2*i.30

Moreover, (cos,sin) 0  is 1 0, and the length along the circle from this base point to 
the point with coordinates (cos,sin) x  is x. Since the monad o. multiplies its 
argument by pi, the circumference of the circle with unit radius is o. 2 , and the sin and 
cos applied to the points o.4%~i.9  yield interesting results. Thus: 
 
   o. 2 6.28319    sin o. 2 _8.67362e_19     clean=: **|    clean sin o. 2 0     ]p=:4%~i.9 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 1.5 1.75 2     clean (cos,:sin) o. p 1 0.707107 0 _0.707107 _1 _0.707107  0  0.707107 1 0 0.707107 1  0.707107  0 _0.707107 _1 _0.707107 0 
Chapter 9 Polynomials  99 
  
 
The monad * used in the definition of clean  above is called signum :  *x is 0 if x is near 
zero, 1 if it is greater than zero, and _1 if it is less than zero.  
K. Summary Of Notation 
The notation introduced in this chapter comprises complex numbers ( 3j4) and the 
corresponding verb j. (as in 3 j. 4  and j. 4 ); three conjunctions under , odd and even 
(&. .: .. ); and six monads:   sine, cosine, sinh, cosh , signum,  and exponential, (1 2 5 
6&o. *  ^). 
L. On Language 
In accord with the comments in the language  section of Chapter 1, notation has been 
introduced sparingly, only as needed in th e topics under discussion. As a consequence, 
many important language constr ucts have been ignored. This section presents a sampling 
of them, grouped according to contexts in which they commonly arise. 
Programming.  Computer programming concerns the definition and use of verbs in a 
language executable on a computer, and progr amming therefore runs through this entire 
text. Nevertheless, it might not be recognized as such by programmers familiar with other 
languages, primarily because it is tacit rather than explicit. 
A tacit definition is one in which no explicit men tion is made of the arguments to which 
the defined verb might apply. For example: 
 
   IQ=: <.@%  Integer quotient of arguments.  
   317 IQ 10 
31 
 
   IQ 0.166 Integer reciprocal of argument.  
6 
 
An explicit  definition begins with an entry that includes the phrase 3 : 0 , and follows 
with sentences that use x. and y. to denote the arguments, uses a colon alone on a line to 
separate the definitions of the monadic and dyadic cases, and concludes with a right 
parenthesis alone on a line. For example: 
 
   iq=: 3 : 0 if. y. < 0    do. 0   else. %: y. end. : <. x. % y. ) 
 
   iq \ 25 5 
 
   iq _25 0 
 
100  Arithmetic 
 
   317 iq 10 
31 
 
Tacit definitions facilitate the use of structured  programming, in which complicated 
functions are defined in terms of a hierarchy of simpler functions, each of which is useful 
in its own right. The following example is from statistics: 
   std=: sqrt@var Standard deviation  
     var=: mean@sqr@norm Variance 
       norm=: ] - mean Normalization  
         mean=: +/ % # Mean

Adverbs And Conjunctions.  Adverbs and conjunctions may be  defined either tacitly or 
explicitly. The following illustrates the tacit definition of adverbs: 
 
   ]a=: 1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 3 4 5 
 
   prsu=: \\. A sequence of adverbs  (prefix and suffix)

The tacit definition of conjunctions will be  illustrated first by using the case adverb-
conjunction-adverb, whose result can be used  to provide the ordinary matrix product:  
   dot=: /@(("0 1)("1 _)) 
   m=:i.3 3    m m + dot * m 0 1 2 15 18  21 3 4 5 42 54  66 6 7 8 69 90 111  
102  Arithmetic 
 
A second illustration produces a conjunction that applies one of its arguments to a prefix, 
and the other to a suffix: 
 
   ps=: 2 : '(x.@{.)`,`(y.@}.)\'    f=: *: ps %:    3 f 2 3 4 5 6  f"0 1~i. 5 4 9 16 2.23607 2.44949  0 1 1.41421 1.73205 2     1 f 2 3 4 5 6  0 1 1.41421 1.73205 2 4 1.73205 2 2.23607 2.44949 0 1 1.41421 1.73205 2     f 2 3 4 5 6  0 1       4 1.73205 2 4 1.73205 2 2.23607 2.44949  0 1       4       9 2  
Gerunds.  The conjunction ` “ties” verbs together to form a gerund , a noun that (like the 
English word cooking ) carries the force of a verb. Gerunds have a variety of uses, of 
which two are illustrated below: 
 
   +`*/ 1 2 3 4 5  Insertion of successive verbs  
47 
   1+2*3+4*5 47  
   fac_or_sqr=: !`*: @. (>&5) 
The conjunction @.(agenda) 
   fac_or_sqr 8 uses the index produced by  
64 its right argument to select a  
   fac_or_sqr 5 member of the gerund to  
120 produce the final result.  
 
   fac_or_sqr"0 i. 10   1 1 2 6 24 120 36 49 64 81 
Recursion. A function that is defined in terms of itself is said to be recursively  defined. 
For example: 
 
   fac=: 1:`(] * fac@<:)@.* 
   fac 5 fac"0 i.6 120 1 1 2 6 24 120 
 
The 1: is the constant function that yields 1, and the monad * (signum ) yields 1 if its 
argument is greater than 0. 
Controlled Iteration.  If f and g are functions and h=: f ^: g , then x h y “iterates” 
f by applying it repeatedly as long as the result of g is non-zero. For example, an 
iterative determination of the square root  using Newton’s method may be defined as 
follows: 
 
   h=: (-:@(] + %))^:([ ~: *:@]) ^: _    5 h 1 2.23607     *: 5 h 1 
Chapter 9 Polynomials  103 
  
5 
    1 2 3 4 5 h"0 (1) 1 1.41421 1.73205 2 2.23607  
Linear Functions.  The expression mp=:+/ . *  uses the dot conjunction to produce the 
dot, inner , or matrix  product mp. For example: 
 
   mp=: +/ . *    v=: i.3 m=: i. 3 3    m  m mp m 0 1 2 15 18  21 3 4 5 42 54  66 6 7 8 69 90 111     m mp v v mp m 5 14 23 15 18 21  
Moreover, m&mp  is a linear function which (as stated in Section 2 D) distributes over 
addition. For example: 
 
   LF=: m&mp    a=: 2 3 4 b=: 5 1 1    LF (a+b) (LF a)+(LF b) 14 62 110 14 62 110     LF (m+2*m) (LF m)+(LF 2*m)  45  54  63 45  54  63 126 162 198 126 162 198 207 270 333 207 270 333  
Any linear function LF can be represented in the form M&mp  for a suitable matrix M. If LF 
applies to vectors of n elements, then M may be obtained by applying LF to the identity 
matrix =i.n . For example, if p is an arbitrary permutation vector, then the permutation 
function p&{ is linear and: 
 
   n=: 6 ]p=: n?n    5 2 1 3 0 4    LF=: p&{    x=:2 3 5 7 11 13    LF x 13 5 3 7 2 11     M=: LF =i.n    M&mp x 13 5 3 7 2 11     M %. M 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

+/\c I=: =/~i.#c M=: +/\ I d=: M +/ . * c (%.M) +/ . * d (>:/~i.#c) +/ . * c 
L3 Look through earlier chapters for other linear functions, and re-express them as 
inner products. In particular, identify the cases that can employ Pascal’s triangle (
!/~i.n ) and Vandermonde’s matrix x^/i.#c . 
L4 Predict and test the results of applying the matrix inversion function %. to some of 
the matrices used in Exercises L2 and L3, and use them in defining linear 
functions. 
L5 Examine the matrices M and %.M of Ex L2, and note that the former produces 
“aggregation” or “integration”, a nd the latter produces “differencing”. 
L6 Review the discussion of combinations in Section 7 C, and enter and experiment 
with the following structured definition of a function for generating tables of combinations: 
        
comb=: basis`recur@.test 
      basis=:i.@(<:,[)       recur=: (count#start),.(index@count{comb&.<:)          count=:<:@[!<:@[+|.@start          start=:i.@-.@-          index=:;@:((i.-])&.>)       test=: *@[*.<
 
[Try 3 comb 4]
