xviiiAcknowledgments
We greatly appreciate the pioneering work of Richard Stallman, without whom 
there would never have been the GNU Project, and of Linus T orvalds, without whom there would never have been the Linux kernel. Countless others have workedon parts of the GNU/Linux operating system, and we thank them all.
We thank the faculties of Harvard and Rice for our undergraduate educations, and
Caltech and Stanford for our graduate training. Without all who taught us, we wouldnever have dared to teach others!
W . Richard Stevens wrote three excellent books on UNIX programming, and we have
consulted them extensively. Roland McGrath, Ulrich Drepper, and many others wrotethe GNU C library and its outstanding documentation.
Robert Brazile and Sam Kendall reviewed early outlines of this book and made won-
derful suggestions about tone and content. Our technical editors and reviewers (espe-cially Glenn Becker and John Dean) pointed out errors, made suggestions, and providedcontinuous encouragement. Of course, any errors that remain are no fault of theirs!

xxIntroduction
GNU/Linux has taken the world of computers by storm.At one time, personal com-
puter users were forced to choose among proprietary operating environments andapplications. Users had no way of ﬁxing or improving these programs, could not look“under the hood,” and were often forced to accept restrictive licenses. GNU/Linuxand other open source systems have changed that—now PC users, administrators, anddevelopers can choose a free operating environment complete with tools, applications,and full source code.
A great deal of the success of GNU/Linux is owed to its open source nature.
Because the source code for programs is publicly available, everyone can take part indevelopment, whether by ﬁxing a small bug or by developing and distributing a com-plete major application.This opportunity has enticed thousands of capable developersworldwide to contribute new components and improvements to GNU/Linux, to thepoint that modern GNU/Linux systems rival the features of any proprietary system,and distributions include thousands of programs and applications spanning many CD-ROMs or DVDs.
The success of GNU/Linux has also validated much of the UNIX philosophy.
Many of the application programming interfaces (APIs) introduced in AT&T and BSDUNIX variants survive in Linux and form the foundation on which programs arebuilt.The UNIX philosophy of many small command line-oriented programs workingtogether is the organizational principle that makes GNU/Linux so powerful. Evenwhen these programs are wrapped in easy-to-use graphical user interfaces, the under-lying commands are still available for power users and automated scripts.
A powerful GNU/Linux application harnesses the power of these APIs and com-
mands in its inner workings. GNU/Linux’s APIs provide access to sophisticated fea-tures such as interprocess communication, multithreading, and high-performancenetworking.And many problems can be solved simply by assembling existing com-mands and programs using simple scripts.
GNU and Linux
Where did the name GNU/Liux come from? Y ou’ve certainly heard of Linux before,and you may have heard of the GNU Project.Y ou may not have heard the nameGNU/Linux, although you’re probably familiar with the system it refers to.
Linux is named after Linus T orvalds, the creator and original author of the kernel
that runs a GNU/Linux system.The kernel is the program that performs the mostbasic functions of an operating system: It controls and interfaces with the computer’shardware, handles allocation of memory and other resources, allows multiple programsto run at the same time, manages the ﬁle system, and so on.00 0430 FM  5/22/01  2:32 PM  Page xx
xxiThe kernel by itself doesn’t provide features that are useful to users. It can’t even
provide a simple prompt for users to enter basic commands. It provides no way forusers to manage or edit ﬁles, communicate with other computers, or write other pro-grams.These tasks require the use of a wide array of other programs, including com-mand shells, ﬁle utilities, editors, and compilers. Many of these programs, in turn, uselibraries of general-purpose functions, such as the library containing standard C libraryfunctions, which are not included in the kernel.
On GNU/Linux systems, many of these other programs and libraries are software
developed as part of the GNU Project.
1A great deal of this software predates the
Linux kernel.The aim of the GNU Project is “to develop a complete UNIX-likeoperating system which is free software” (from the GNU Project Web site,
http://www.gnu.org ).
The Linux kernel and software from the GNU Project has proven to be a powerful
combination.Although the combination is often called “Linux” for short, the completesystem couldn’t work without GNU software, any more than it could operate withoutthe kernel. For this reason, throughout this book we’ll refer to the complete system asGNU/Linux, except when we are speciﬁcally talking about the Linux kernel.
The GNU General Public License
The source code contained in this book is covered by the GNU General Public License
(GPL), which is listed in Appendix F ,“GNU General Public License.”A great deal of
free software, especially GNU/Linux software, is licensed under it. For instance, theLinux kernel itself is licensed under the GPL, as are many other GNU programs andlibraries you’ll ﬁnd in GNU/Linux distributions. If you use the source code in thisbook, be sure to read and understand the terms of the GPL.
The GNU Project Web site includes an extensive discussion of the GPL
(
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/ ) and other free software licenses.Y ou can

Who Should Read This Book?
This book is intended for three types of readers:
nY ou might be a developer already experienced with programming for the
GNU/Linux system, and you want to learn about some of its advanced featuresand capabilities.Y ou might be interested in writing more sophisticated programswith features such as multiprocessing, multithreading, interprocess communica-tion, and interaction with hardware devices.Y ou might want to improve yourprograms by making them run faster, more reliably, and more securely, or bydesigning them to interact better with the rest of the GNU/Linux system.
1. GNU is a recursive acronym: It stands for “GNU’s Not UNIX.”00 0430 FM  5/22/01  2:32 PM  Page xxi
xxiinY ou might be a developer experienced with another UNIX-like system who’s
interested in developing GNU/Linux software, too.Y ou might already be famil-iar with standard APIs such as those in the POSIX speciﬁcation.T o developGNU/Linux software, you need to know the peculiarities of the system, its limitations, additional capabilities, and conventions.
nY ou might be a developer making the transition from a non-UNIX environ-ment, such as Microsoft’s Win32 platform.Y ou might already be familiar withthe general principles of writing good software, but you need to know the spe-ciﬁc techniques that GNU/Linux programs use to interact with the system andwith each other.And you want to make sure your programs ﬁt naturally into theGNU/Linux system and behave as users expect them to.
This book is not intended to be a comprehensive guide or reference to all aspects of
GNU/Linux programming. Instead, we’ll take a tutorial approach, introducing themost important concepts and techniques, and giving examples of how to use them.Section 1.5,“Finding More Information,” in Chapter 1,“Getting Started,” containsreferences to additional documentation, where you can obtain complete details aboutthese and other aspects of GNU/Linux programming.
Because this is a book about advanced topics, we’ll assume that you are already
familiar with the C programming language and that you know how to use the stan-dard C library functions in your programs.The C language is the most widely usedlanguage for developing GNU/Linux software; most of the commands and librariesthat we discuss in this book, and most of the Linux kernel itself, are written in C.
The information in this book is equally applicable to C++ programs because that
language is roughly a superset of C. Even if you program in another language, you’llﬁnd this information useful because C language APIs and conventions are the lingua
franca of GNU/Linux.
If you’ve programmed on another UNIX-like system platform before, chances are
good that you already know your way around Linux’s low-level I/O functions (
open,
read,stat, and so on).These are different from the standard C library’s I/O functions
(fopen ,fprintf ,fscanf , and so on). Both are useful in GNU/Linux programming, and
we use both sets of I/O functions throughout this book. If you’re not familiar withthe low-level I/O functions, jump to the end of the book and read Appendix B,“Low-Level I/O,” before you start Chapter 2,“Writing Good GNU/Linux Software.”00 0430 FM  5/22/01  2:32 PM  Page xxii
xxiiiThis book does not provide a general introduction to GNU/Linux systems.
We assume that you already have a basic knowledge of how to interact with aGNU/Linux system and perform basic operations in graphical and command-lineenvironments. If you’re new to GNU/Linux, start with one of the many excellentintroductory books, such as Michael T olber’s Inside Linux (New Riders Publishing,
2001).
Conventions
This book follows a few typographical conventions:
nA new term is set in italics the ﬁrst time it is introduced.
nProgram text, functions, variables, and other “computer language” are set in a
ﬁxed-pitch font—for example, printf (“Hello, world!\bksl n”) .
nNames of commands, ﬁles, and directories are also set in a ﬁxed-pitch font—forexample,
cd /.
nWhen we show interactions with a command shell, we use %as the shell prompt
(your shell is probably conﬁgured to use a different prompt). Everything afterthe prompt is what you type, while other lines of text are the system’s response.
For example, in this interaction
% uname

THIS CHAPTER SHOWS YOU HOW TO PERFORM THE BASIC steps required to create a 
C or C++ Linux program. In particular, this chapter shows you how to create andmodify C and C++ source code, compile that code, and debug the result. If you ’re
already accustomed to programming under Linux, you can skip ahead to Chapter 2,“Writing Good GNU/Linux Software; ”pay careful attention to Section 2.3, “Writing
and Using Libraries, ”for information about static versus dynamic linking that you
might not already know.
Throughout this book, we ’ll assume that you ’re familiar with the C or C++ pro-
gramming languages and the most common functions in the standard C library.Thesource code examples in this book are in C, except when demonstrating a particularfeature or complication of C++ programming.We also assume that you know how toperform basic operations in the Linux command shell, such as creating directories andcopying files. Because many Linux programmers got started programming in theWindows environment, we ’ll occasionally point out similarities and contrasts between
Windows and Linux.02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 3

1.1 Editing with Emacs
An editor is the program that you use to edit source code. Lots of different editors are
available for Linux, but the most popular and full-featured editor is probably GNUEmacs.
About Emacs
Emacs is much more than an editor. It is an incredibly powerful program, so much so that atCodeSourcery, it is affectionately known as the One True Program, or just the OTP for short. You can readand send email from within Emacs, and you can customize and extend Emacs in ways far too numerousto discuss here. You can even browse the Web from within Emacs!
If you ’re familiar with another editor, you can certainly use it instead. Nothing in the
rest of this book depends on using Emacs. If you don ’t already have a favorite Linux
editor, then you should follow along with the mini-tutorial given here.
If you like Emacs and want to learn about its advanced features, you might consider
reading one of the many Emacs books available. One excellent tutorial, Learning 
GNU Emacs , is written by Debra Cameron, Bill Rosenblatt, and Eric S. Raymond
(O’Reilly, 1996).
1.1.1 Opening a C or C++ Source File
Y ou can start Emacs by typing emacs in your terminal window and pressing the
Return key.When Emacs has been started, you can use the menus at the top to createa new source file. Click the Files menu, choose Open Files, and then type the name ofthe file that you want to open in the “minibuffer ”at the bottom of the screen.
1If you
want to create a C source file, use a filename that ends in .cor .h. If you want to 
create a C++ source file, use a filename that ends in .cpp,.hpp,.cxx,.hxx,.C, or .H.
When the file is open, you can type as you would in any ordinary word-processingprogram.T o save the file, choose the Save Buffer entry on the Files menu.Whenyou’re finished using Emacs, you can choose the Exit Emacs option on the Files
menu.
If you don ’t like to point and click, you can use keyboard shortcuts to automatically
open files, save files, and exit Emacs.T o open a file, type 
C-x C-f . (The C-xmeans to
hold down the Control key and then press the xkey.) T o save a file, type C-x C-s .T o
exit Emacs, just type C-x C-c . If you want to get a little better acquainted with Emacs,
choose the Emacs Tutorial entry on the Help menu.The tutorial provides you withlots of tips on how to use Emacs effectively.
1. If you ’re not running in an X Window system, you ’ll have to press F10 to access the
menus.02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 4
5 1.1 Editing with Emacs
1.1.2 Automatic Formatting
If you ’re accustomed to programming in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) ,
you’ll also be accustomed to having the editor help you format your code. Emacs can
provide the same kind of functionality. If you open a C or C++ source file, Emacsautomatically figures out that the file contains source code, not just ordinary text. Ifyou hit the Tab key on a blank line, Emacs moves the cursor to an appropriatelyindented point. If you hit the Tab key on a line that already contains some text, Emacsindents the text. So, for example, suppose that you have typed in the following:
int main (){printf (“Hello, world\n”);}
If you press the Tab key on the line with the call to printf , Emacs will reformat your
code to look like this:
int main (){
printf (“Hello, world\n”);
}
Notice how the line has been appropriately indented.
As you use Emacs more, you ’ll see how it can help you perform all kinds of 
complicated formatting tasks. If you ’re ambitious, you can program Emacs to perform
literally any kind of automatic formatting you can imagine. People have used this facility to implement Emacs modes for editing just about every kind of document,to implement games
2, and to implement database front ends.
1.1.3 Syntax Highlighting
In addition to formatting your code, Emacs can make it easier to read C and C++code by coloring different syntax elements. For example, Emacs can turn keywordsone color, built-in types such as 
intanother color, and comments another color.
Using color makes it a lot easier to spot some common syntax errors.
The easiest way to turn on colorization is to edit the file ~/.emacs and insert the
following string:
(global-font-lock-mode t)
Save the file, exit Emacs, and restart. Now open a C or C++ source file and enjoy!
Y ou might have noticed that the string you inserted into your .emacs looks like
code from the LISP programming language.That ’s because it isLISP code! Much of
Emacs is actually written in LISP .Y ou can add functionality to Emacs by writing moreLISP code.

6 Chapter 1 Getting Started
1.2 Compiling with GCC
A compiler turns human-readable source code into machine-readable object code that
can actually run.The compilers of choice on Linux systems are all part of the GNUCompiler Collection, usually known as GCC.
3GCC also include compilers for C,
C++, Java, Objective-C, Fortran, and Chill.This book focuses mostly on C and C++programming.
Suppose that you have a project like the one in Listing 1.2 with one C++ source
file (
reciprocal.cpp ) and one C source file ( main.c ) like in Listing 1.1.These two files
are supposed to be compiled and then linked together to produce a program called
reciprocal .4This program will compute the reciprocal of an integer.
Listing 1.1 (main.c ) C source file —main.c
#include <stdio.h>#include “reciprocal.hpp”int main (int argc, char **argv){
int i;i = atoi (argv[1]);printf (“The reciprocal of %d is %g\n”, i, reciprocal (i));return 0;
}
Listing 1.2 (reciprocal.cpp ) C++ source file —reciprocal.cpp
#include <cassert>#include “reciprocal.hpp”double reciprocal (int i) {
// I should be non-zero.assert (i != 0);return 1.0/i;
}
3. For more information about GCC, visit http://gcc.gnu.org .
4. In Windows, executables usually have names that end in .exe. Linux programs, on the
other hand, usually have no extension. So, the Windows equivalent of this program wouldprobably be called 
reciprocal.exe ; the Linux version is just plain reciprocal .02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 6
7 1.2 Compiling with GCC
There ’s also one header file called reciprocal.hpp (see Listing 1.3).
Listing 1.3 ( reciprocal.hpp ) Header file —reciprocal.hpp
#ifdef __cplusplusextern “C” {#endifextern  double reciprocal (int i);#ifdef __cplusplus}
#endif
The first step is to turn the C and C++ source code into object code.
1.2.1 Compiling a Single Source File
The name of the C compiler is gcc. T o compile a C source file, you use the -c
option. So, for example, entering this at the command prompt compiles the main.c
source file:
% gcc -c main.c
The resulting object file is named main.o .
The C++ compiler is called g++. Its operation is very similar to gcc; compiling
reciprocal.cpp is accomplished by entering the following:
% g++ -c reciprocal.cpp
The -coption tells g++to compile the program to an object file only; without it, g++
will attempt to link the program to produce an executable.After you ’ve typed this
command, you ’ll have an object file called reciprocal.o .
Yo u’ll probably need a couple other options to build any reasonably large program.
The -Ioption is used to tell GCC where to search for header files. By default, GCC
looks in the current directory and in the directories where headers for the standardlibraries are installed. If you need to include header files from somewhere else, you ’ll
need the 
-Ioption. For example, suppose that your project has one directory called
src, for source files, and another called include .Y ou would compile reciprocal.cpp
like this to indicate that g++should use the ../include directory in addition to find
reciprocal.hpp :
% g++ -c -I ../include reciprocal.cpp02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 7
8 Chapter 1 Getting Started
Sometimes you ’ll want to define macros on the command line. For example, in 
production code, you don ’t want the overhead of the assertion check present in 
reciprocal.cpp ; that’s only there to help you debug the program.Y ou turn off 
the check by defining the macro NDEBUG .Y ou could add an explicit #define to 
reciprocal.cpp , but that would require changing the source itself. It ’s easier to 
simply define NDEBUG on the command line, like this:
% g++ -c -D NDEBUG reciprocal.cpp
If you had wanted to define NDEBUG to some particular value, you could have done
something like this:
% g++ -c -D NDEBUG=3 reciprocal.cpp
If you ’re really building production code, you probably want to have GCC optimize
the code so that it runs as quickly as possible.Y ou can do this by using the -O2
command-line option. (GCC has several different levels of optimization; the secondlevel is appropriate for most programs.) For example, the following compiles 
reciprocal.cpp with optimization turned on:
% g++ -c -O2 reciprocal.cpp
Note that compiling with optimization can make your program more difficult todebug with a debugger (see Section 1.4, “Debugging with GDB ”).Also, in certain
instances, compiling with optimization can uncover bugs in your program that did notmanifest themselves previously.
Y ou can pass lots of other options to 
gccand g++.The best way to get a complete
list is to view the online documentation.Y ou can do this by typing the following atyour command prompt:
% info gcc
1.2.2 Linking Object Files
Now that you ’ve compiled main.c and utilities.cpp ,y o u’ll want to link them.Y ou
should always use g++to link a program that contains C++ code, even if it also con-
tains C code. If your program contains only C code, you should use gccinstead.
Because this program contains both C and C++, you should use g++, like this:
% g++ -o reciprocal main.o reciprocal.o
The -ooption gives the name of the file to generate as output from the link step.
Now you can run reciprocal like this:
% ./reciprocal 7The reciprocal of 7 is 0.142857
As you can see, g++has automatically linked in the standard C runtime library con-
taining the implementation of printf . If you had needed to link in another library
(such as a graphical user interface toolkit), you would have specified the library with02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 8
9 1.3 Automating the Process with GNU Make
the -loption. In Linux, library names almost always start with lib. For example,
the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) library is called libpam.a .T o link in 
libpam.a , you use a command like this:
% g++ -o reciprocal main.o reciprocal.o -lpam
The compiler automatically adds the libprefix and the .asuffix.
As with header files, the linker looks for libraries in some standard places, including
the /lib and /usr/lib directories that contain the standard system libraries. If you
want the linker to search other directories as well, you should use the -Loption,
which is the parallel of the -Ioption discussed earlier.Y ou can use this line to instruct
the linker to look for libraries in the /usr/local/lib/pam directory before looking in
the usual places:
% g++ -o reciprocal main.o reciprocal.o -L/usr/local/lib/pam -lpam
Although you don ’t have to use the -Ioption to get the preprocessor to search the
current directory, you do have to use the -Loption to get the linker to search the 
current directory. In particular, you could use the following to instruct the linker tofind the 
test library in the current directory:
% gcc -o app app.o -L. -ltest
1.3 Automating the Process with GNU Make
If you ’re accustomed to programming for the Windows operating system, you ’re prob-
ably accustomed to working with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).Y ouadd sources files to your project, and then the IDE builds your project automatically.Although IDEs are available for Linux, this book doesn ’t discuss them. Instead, this
book shows you how to use GNU Make to automatically recompile your code, whichis what most Linux programmers actually do.
The basic idea behind 
make is simple.Y ou tell make what targets you want to build
and then give rulesexplaining how to build them.Y ou also specify dependencies that
indicate when a particular target should be rebuilt.
In our sample reciprocal project, there are three obvious targets: reciprocal.o ,
main.o , and the reciprocal itself.Y ou already have rules in mind for building these
targets in the form of the command lines given previously.The dependencies require alittle bit of thought. Clearly,
reciprocal depends on reciprocal.o and main.o because
you can ’t link the complete program until you have built each of the object files.The
object files should be rebuilt whenever the corresponding source files change.There ’s
one more twist in that a change to reciprocal.hpp also should cause both of the
object files to be rebuilt because both source files include that header file.
In addition to the obvious targets, there should always be a clean target.This target
removes all the generated object files and programs so that you can start fresh.The rulefor this target uses the 
rmcommand to remove the files.02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 9
10 Chapter 1 Getting Started
Y ou can convey all that information to make by putting the information in a file
named Makefile . Here ’s what Makefile contains:
reciprocal: main.o reciprocal.o
g++ $(CFLAGS) -o reciprocal main.o reciprocal.o
main.o: main.c reciprocal.hpp
gcc $(CFLAGS) -c main.c
reciprocal.o: reciprocal.cpp reciprocal.hpp
g++ $(CFLAGS) -c reciprocal.cpp
clean:
rm -f *.o reciprocal
Y ou can see that targets are listed on the left, followed by a colon and then any depen-dencies.The rule to build that target is on the next line. (Ignore the 
$(CFLAGS) bit 
for the moment.) The line with the rule on it must start with a Tab character, or make
will get confused. If you edit your Makefile in Emacs, Emacs will help you with the
formatting.
If you remove the object files that you ’ve already built, and just type
% make
on the command-line, you ’ll see the following:
% make gcc -c main.cg++ -c reciprocal.cppg++ -o reciprocal main.o reciprocal.o
Y ou can see that make has automatically built the object files and then linked them.
If you now change main.c in some trivial way and type make again, you ’ll see the 
following:
% make gcc -c main.cg++ -o reciprocal main.o reciprocal.o
Y ou can see that make knew to rebuild main.o and to re-link the program, but it 
didn’t bother to recompile reciprocal.cpp because none of the dependencies for 
reciprocal.o had changed.
The $(CFLAGS) is a make variable.Y ou can define this variable either in the
Makefile itself or on the command line. GNU make will substitute the value of the
variable when it executes the rule. So, for example, to recompile with optimizationenabled, you would do this:
% make cleanrm -f *.o reciprocal% make CFLAGS=-O2gcc -O2 -c main.cg++ -O2 -c reciprocal.cppg++ -O2 -o reciprocal main.o reciprocal.o02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 10
11 1.4 Debugging with GNU Debugger (GDB)
Note that the -O2flag was inserted in place of $(CFLAGS) in the rules.
In this section, you ’ve seen only the most basic capabilities of make.Y ou can find
out more by typing this:
% info make
In that manual, you ’ll find information about how to make maintaining a Makefile
easier, how to reduce the number of rules that you need to write, and how to auto-matically compute dependencies.Y ou can also find more information in GNU,
Autoconf,Automake, and Libtool by Gary V .Vaughan, Ben Elliston,T om Tromey, and 
Ian Lance Taylor (New Riders Publishing, 2000).
1.4 Debugging with GNU Debugger (GDB)
The debugger is the program that you use to figure out why your program isn ’t behav-
ing the way you think it should.Y ou ’ll be doing this a lot.5The GNU Debugger
(GDB) is the debugger used by most Linux programmers.Y ou can use GDB to stepthrough your code, set breakpoints, and examine the value of local variables.
1.4.1 Compiling with Debugging Information
T o use GDB, you ’ll have to compile with debugging information enabled. Do this by
adding the -gswitch on the compilation command line. If you ’re using a Makefile as
described previously, you can just set CFLAGS equal to -gwhen you run make, as shown
here:
% make CFLAGS=-ggcc -g -c main.cg++ -g -c reciprocal.cppg++ -g -o reciprocal main.o reciprocal.o
When you compile with -g, the compiler includes extra information in the object files
and executables.The debugger uses this information to figure out which addresses cor-respond to which lines in which source files, how to print out local variables, and soforth.
1.4.2 Running GDB
Y ou can start up gdbby typing:
% gdb reciprocal
When gdbstarts up, you should see the GDB prompt:
(gdb)
5.…unless your programs always work the first time.02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 11
12 Chapter 1 Getting Started
The first step is to run your program inside the debugger. Just enter the command run
and any program arguments.Try running the program without any arguments, likethis:
(gdb) runStarting program: reciprocalProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.__strtol_internal (nptr=0x0, endptr=0x0, base=10, group=0)at strtol.c:287287     strtol.c: No such file or directory.(gdb)
The problem is that there is no error-checking code in main.The program expects
one argument, but in this case the program was run with no arguments.The SIGSEGV
message indicates a program crash. GDB knows that the actual crash happened in afunction called 
__strtol_internal .That function is in the standard library, and the
source isn ’t installed, which explains the “No such file or directory ”message.Y ou can
see the stack by using the where command:
(gdb) where#0  __strtol_internal (nptr=0x0, endptr=0x0, base=10, group=0) 
at strtol.c:287
#1  0x40096fb6 in atoi (nptr=0x0) at ../stdlib/stdlib.h:251#2  0x804863e in main (argc=1, argv=0xbffff5e4) at main.c:8
Y ou can see from this display that main called the atoi function with a NULL pointer,
which is the source of the trouble.
Y ou can go up two levels in the stack until you reach main by using the up
command:
(gdb) up 2#2  0x804863e in main (argc=1, argv=0xbffff5e4) at main.c:88         i = atoi (argv[1]);
Note that gdbis capable of finding the source for main.c , and it shows the line where
the erroneous function call occurred.Y ou can view the value of variables using the
print command:
(gdb) print argv[1]$2 = 0x0
That confirms that the problem is indeed a NULL pointer passed into atoi.
Y ou can set a breakpoint by using the break command:
(gdb) break mainBreakpoint 1 at 0x804862e: file main.c, line 8.02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 12
13 1.5 Finding More Information
This command sets a breakpoint on the first line of main.6Now try rerunning the
program with an argument, like this:
(gdb) run 7Starting program: reciprocal 7Breakpoint 1, main (argc=2, argv=0xbffff5e4) at main.c:88         i = atoi (argv[1]);
Y ou can see that the debugger has stopped at the breakpoint.
Y ou can step over the call to atoi using the next command:
(gdb) next9         printf (“The reciprocal of %d is %g\n”, i, reciprocal (i));
If you want to see what ’s going on inside reciprocal , use the step command like this:
(gdb) stepreciprocal (i=7) at reciprocal.cpp:66         assert (i != 0);
Yo u’re now in the body of the reciprocal function.
Y ou might find it more convenient to run gdbfrom within Emacs rather than using
gdbdirectly from the command line. Use the command M-x gdb to start up gdbin an
Emacs window. If you are stopped at a breakpoint, Emacs automatically pulls up theappropriate source file. It ’s easier to figure out what ’s going on when you ’re looking at
the whole file rather than just one line of text.
1.5 Finding More Information
Nearly every Linux distribution comes with a great deal of useful documentation.Y oucould learn most of what we ’ll talk about in this book by reading documentation in
your Linux distribution (although it would probably take you much longer).The doc-umentation isn ’t always well-organized, though, so the tricky part is finding what you
need. Documentation is also sometimes out-of-date, so take everything that you readwith a grain of salt. If the system doesn ’t behave the way a man page (manual pages)
says it should, for instance, it may be that the man page is outdated.
T o help you navigate, here are the most useful sources of information about
advanced Linux programming.
6. Some people have commented that saying break main is a little bit funny because 
usually you want to do this only when main is already broken.02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 13
14 Chapter 1 Getting Started
1.5.1 Man Pages
Linux distributions include man pages for most standard commands, system calls, andstandard library functions.The man pages are divided into numbered sections; for pro-grammers, the most important are these:
(1) User commands(2) System calls(3) Standard library functions(8) System/administrative commands
The numbers denote man page sections. Linux ’s man pages come installed on your
system; use the 
mancommand to access them.T o look up a man page, simply invoke
man name, where name is a command or function name. In a few cases, the same name
occurs in more than one section; you can specify the section explicitly by placing thesection number before the name. For example, if you type the following, you ’ll get the
man page for the 
sleep command (in section 1 of the Linux man pages):
% man sleep
T o see the man page for the sleep library function, use this command:
% man 3 sleep
Each man page includes a one-line summary of the command or function.The 
whatis name command displays all man pages (in all sections) for a command or 
function matching name. If you ’re not sure which command or function you want,
you can perform a keyword search on the summary lines, using man -k keyword .
Man pages include a lot of very useful information and should be the first place
you turn for help.The man page for a command describes command-line options andarguments, input and output, error codes, configuration, and the like.The man pagefor a system call or library function describes parameters and return values, lists errorcodes and side effects, and specifies which include file to use if you call the function.
1.5.2 Info
The Info documentation system contains more detailed documentation for many corecomponents of the GNU/Linux system, plus several other programs. Info pages arehypertext documents, similar to Web pages.T o launch the text-based Info browser, justtype 
info in a shell window.Y ou ’ll be presented with a menu of Info documents
installed on your system. (Press Control+H to display the keys for navigating an Infodocument.)
Among the most useful Info documents are these:
ngcc—The gcc compiler
nlibc—The GNU C library, including many system calls
ngdb—The GNU debugger02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 14
15 1.5 Finding More Information
nemacs —The Emacs text editor
ninfo—The Info system itself
Almost all the standard Linux programming tools (including ld, the linker; as, the
assembler; and gprof , the profiler) come with useful Info pages.Y ou can jump directly
to a particular Info document by specifying the page name on the command line:
% info libc
If you do most of your programming in Emacs, you can access the built-in Infobrowser by typing 
M-x info or C-h i .
1.5.3 Header Files
Y ou can learn a lot about the system functions that are available and how to use them by looking at the system header files.These reside in 
/usr/include and 
/usr/include/sys . If you are getting compile errors from using a system call, for
instance, take a look in the corresponding header file to verify that the function ’s 
signature is the same as what ’s listed in the man page.
On Linux systems, a lot of the nitty-gritty details of how the system calls work are
reflected in header files in the directories /usr/include/bits ,/usr/include/asm , and
/usr/include/linux . For instance, the numerical values of signals (described in Section
3.3,“Signals, ”in Chapter 3, “Processes ”) are defined in /usr/include/bits/signum.h .
These header files make good reading for inquiring minds. Don ’t include them
directly in your programs, though; always use the header files in /usr/include or as
mentioned in the man page for the function you ’re using.
1.5.4 Source Code
This is Open Source, right? The final arbiter of how the system works is the systemsource code itself, and luckily for Linux programmers, that source code is freely avail-able. Chances are, your Linux distribution includes full source code for the entire sys-tem and all programs included with it; if not, you ’re entitled under the terms of the
GNU General Public License to request it from the distributor. (The source codemight not be installed on your disk, though. See your distribution ’s documentation for
instructions on installing it.)
The source code for the Linux kernel itself is usually stored under 
/usr/src/linux .
If this book leaves you thirsting for details of how processes, shared memory, and sys-tem devices work, you can always learn straight from the source code. Most of thesystem functions described in this book are implemented in the GNU C library;check your distribution ’s documentation for the location of the C library source code.02 0430 CH01  5/22/01  10:19 AM  Page 15

Writing Good GNU/Linux

THIS CHAPTER COVERS SOME BASIC TECHNIQUES THAT MOST GNU/Linux program-
mers use. By following the guidelines presented, you ’ll be able to write programs that
work well within the GNU/Linux environment and meet GNU/Linux users ’expec-
tations of how programs should operate.
2.1 Interaction With the Execution Environment
When you first studied C or C++, you learned that the special main function is the
primary entry point for a program.When the operating system executes your pro-gram, it automatically provides certain facilities that help the program communicatewith the operating system and the user.Y ou probably learned about the two parame-ters to 
main, usually called argc and argv, which receive inputs to your program.
Y ou learned about the stdout and stdin (or the cout and cinstreams in C++) that
provide console input and output.These features are provided by the C and C++ languages, and they interact with the GNU/Linux system in certain ways. GNU/Linux provides other ways for interacting with the operating environment, too.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 17
18 Chapter 2 Writing Good GNU/Linux Software
2.1.1 The Argument List
Y ou run a program from a shell prompt by typing the name of the program.Optionally, you can supply additional information to the program by typing one ormore words after the program name, separated by spaces.These are called command-line
arguments . (Y ou can also include an argument that contains a space, by enclosing the
argument in quotes.) More generally, this is referred to as the program ’s argument list
because it need not originate from a shell command line. In Chapter 3, “Processes, ”
you’ll see another way of invoking a program, in which a program can specify the
argument list of another program directly.
When a program is invoked from the shell, the argument list contains the entire
command line, including the name of the program and any command-line argumentsthat may have been provided. Suppose, for example, that you invoke the 
lscommand
in your shell to display the contents of the root directory and corresponding file sizeswith this command line:
% ls -s /
The argument list that the lsprogram receives has three elements.The first one is the
name of the program itself, as specified on the command line, namely ls.The second
and third elements of the argument list are the two command-line arguments, -sand /.
The main function of your program can access the argument list via the argc and
argv parameters to main (if you don ’t use them, you may simply omit them).The first
parameter, argc, is an integer that is set to the number of items in the argument list.
The second parameter, argv, is an array of character pointers.The size of the array is
argc, and the array elements point to the elements of the argument list, as NUL-
terminated character strings.
Using command-line arguments is as easy as examining the contents of argc and
argv. If you ’re not interested in the name of the program itself, don ’t forget to skip the
first element.
Listing 2.1 demonstrates how to use argc and argv.
Listing 2.1 (arglist.c ) Using argcand argv
#include <stdio.h>int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
printf (“The name of this program is ‘%s’.\n”, argv[0]);printf (“This program was invoked with %d arguments.\n”, argc - 1);/* Were any command-line arguments specified?  */if (argc > 1) {
/* Yes, print them.  */int i;printf (“The arguments are:\n”);for (i = 1; i < argc; ++i)03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 18

printf (“  %s\n”, argv[i]);
}return 0;
}
2.1.2 GNU/Linux Command-Line Conventions
Almost all GNU/Linux programs obey some conventions about how command-linearguments are interpreted.The arguments that programs expect fall into two cate-gories: options (or flags) and other arguments. Options modify how the program
behaves, while other arguments provide inputs (for instance, the names of input files).
Options come in two forms:
nShort options consist of a single hyphen and a single character (usually a lowercase
or uppercase letter). Short options are quicker to type.
nLong options consist of two hyphens, followed by a name made of lowercase and
uppercase letters and hyphens. Long options are easier to remember and easierto read (in shell scripts, for instance).
Usually, a program provides both a short form and a long form for most options itsupports, the former for brevity and the latter for clarity. For example, most programsunderstand the options 
-hand --help , and treat them identically. Normally, when a
program is invoked from the shell, any desired options follow the program nameimmediately. Some options expect an argument immediately following. Many pro-grams, for example, interpret the option 
--output foo to specify that output of the
program should be placed in a file named foo.After the options, there may follow
other command-line arguments, typically input files or input data.
For example, the command ls -s / displays the contents of the root directory.The
-soption modifies the default behavior of lsby instructing it to display the size (in
kilobytes) of each entry.The /argument tells ls which directory to list.The --size
option is synonymous with -s, so the same command could have been invoked as 
ls --size / .
TheGNU Coding Standards list the names of some commonly used command-line
options. If you plan to provide any options similar to these, it ’s a good idea to use the
names specified in the coding standards.Y our program will behave more like otherprograms and will be easier for users to learn.Y ou can view the GNU CodingStandards ’guidelines for command-line options by invoking the following from a shell
prompt on most GNU/Linux systems:

2.1.3 Using getopt_long
Parsing command-line options is a tedious chore. Luckily, the GNU C library providesa function that you can use in C and C++ programs to make this job somewhat easier(although still a bit annoying).This function,
getopt_long , understands both short and
long options. If you use this function, include the header file <getopt.h> .
Suppose, for example, that you are writing a program that is to accept the three
options shown in Table 2.1.
Table 2.1 Example Program Options
Short Form Long Form Purpose
-h --help Display usage summary and exit
-o filename --output filename Specify output filename
-v --verbose Print verbose messages
In addition, the program is to accept zero or more additional command-line arguments, which are the names of input files.
T o use 
getopt_long , you must provide two data structures.The first is a character
string containing the valid short options, each a single letter.An option that requiresan argument is followed by a colon. For your program, the string 
ho:v indicates that
the valid options are -h,-o, and -v, with the second of these options followed by an
argument.
T o specify the available long options, you construct an array of struct option ele-
ments. Each element corresponds to one long option and has four fields. In normalcircumstances, the first field is the name of the long option (as a character string, with-out the two hyphens); the second is 1 if the option takes an argument, or 0 otherwise;the third is 
NULL; and the fourth is a character constant specifying the short option
synonym for that long option.The last element of the array should be all zeros.Y oucould construct the array like this:
const struct option long_options[] = {
{ “help”,     0, NULL, ‘h’ },{ “output”,   1, NULL, ‘o’ },{ “verbose”,  0, NULL, ‘v’ },{ NULL,       0, NULL, 0   }
};
Y ou invoke the getopt_long function, passing it the argc and argv arguments to main,
the character string describing short options, and the array of struct option elements
describing the long options.
nEach time you call getopt_long , it parses a single option, returning the short-
option letter for that option, or –1 if no more options are found.
nT ypically, you ’ll call getopt_long in a loop, to process all the options the user has
specified, and you ’ll handle the specific options in a switch statement.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 20
21 2.1 Interaction With the Execution Environment
nIf getopt_long encounters an invalid option (an option that you didn ’t specify as
a valid short or long option), it prints an error message and returns the character
?(a question mark). Most programs will exit in response to this, possibly after
displaying usage information.
nWhen handling an option that takes an argument, the global variable optarg
points to the text of that argument.
nAfter getopt_long has finished parsing all the options, the global variable optind
contains the index (into argv) of the first nonoption argument.
Listing 2.2 shows an example of how you might use getopt_long to process your
arguments.
Listing 2.2 (getopt_long.c ) Using getopt_long
#include <getopt.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>/* The name of this program.  */const char* program_name;/* Prints usage information for this program to STREAM (typically
stdout or stderr), and exit the program with EXIT_CODE.  Does notreturn.  */
void print_usage (FILE* stream, int exit_code){
fprintf (stream, “Usage:  %s options [ inputfile ... ]\n”, program_name);fprintf (stream,
“  -h  --help             Display this usage information.\n”“  -o  --output filename  Write output to file.\n”“  -v  --verbose          Print verbose messages.\n”);

program_name = argv[0];do {

if (verbose) {
int i;for (i = optind; i < argc; ++i) 
printf (“Argument: %s\n”, argv[i]);

}
Using getopt_long may seem like a lot of work, but writing code to parse the 
command-line options yourself would take even longer.The getopt_long function is
very sophisticated and allows great flexibility in specifying what kind of options toaccept. However, it ’s a good idea to stay away from the more advanced features and
stick with the basic option structure described.
2.1.4 Standard I/O
The standard C library provides standard input and output streams ( stdin and stdout ,
respectively).These are used by scanf ,printf , and other library functions. In the
UNIX tradition, use of standard input and output is customary for GNU/Linux pro-grams.This allows the chaining of multiple programs using shell pipes and input andoutput redirection. (See the man page for your shell to learn its syntax.)
The C library also provides 
stderr , the standard error stream. Programs should
print warning and error messages to standard error instead of standard output.Thisallows users to separate normal output and error messages, for instance, by redirectingstandard output to a file while allowing standard error to print on the console.The
fprintf function can be used to print to stderr , for example:
fprintf (stderr, (“Error: ...”));
These three streams are also accessible with the underlying UNIX I/O commands(
read,write , and so on) via file descriptors.These are file descriptors 0 for stdin , 1 for
stdout , and 2 for stderr .
When invoking a program, it is sometimes useful to redirect both standard output
and standard error to a file or pipe.The syntax for doing this varies among shells; forBourne-style shells (including 
bash, the default shell on most GNU/Linux distribu-
tions), the syntax is this:
% program > output_file.txt 2>&1% program 2>&1 
|filter
The 2>&1 syntax indicates that file descriptor 2 ( stderr ) should be merged into 
file descriptor 1 ( stdout ). Note that 2>&1 must follow a file redirection (the first exam-
ple) but must precede a pipe redirection (the second example).03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 23
24 Chapter 2 Writing Good GNU/Linux Software
Note that stdout is buffered. Data written to stdout is not sent to the console 
(or other device, if it ’s redirected) until the buffer fills, the program exits normally, or
stdout is closed.Y ou can explicitly flush the buffer by calling the following:
fflush (stdout);
In contrast, stderr is not buffered; data written to stderr goes directly to the console.1
This can produce some surprising results. For example, this loop does not print oneperiod every second; instead, the periods are buffered, and a bunch of them are printedtogether when the buffer fills.
while (1) {
printf (“.”);sleep (1);
}
In this loop, however, the periods do appear once a second:
while (1) {
fprintf (stderr, “.”);sleep (1);
}
2.1.5 Program Exit Codes
When a program ends, it indicates its status with an exit code.The exit code is a small integer; by convention, an exit code of zero denotes successful execution,while nonzero exit codes indicate that an error occurred. Some programs use differentnonzero exit code values to distinguish specific errors.
With most shells, it ’s possible to obtain the exit code of the most recently executed
program using the special 
$?variable. Here ’s an example in which the lscommand is
invoked twice and its exit code is printed after each invocation. In the first case, ls
executes correctly and returns the exit code zero. In the second case, lsencounters an
error (because the filename specified on the command line does not exist) and thusreturns a nonzero exit code.
% ls /bin   coda  etc   lib         misc  nfs  proc  sbin  usrboot  dev   home  lost+found  mnt   opt  root  tmp   var% echo $?0% ls bogusfilels: bogusfile: No such file or directory% echo $?1
1. In C++, the same distinction holds for cout and cerr, respectively. Note that the endl
token flushes a stream in addition to printing a newline character; if you don ’t want to flush the
stream (for performance reasons, for example), use a newline constant, ‘\n’, instead.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 24
25 2.1 Interaction With the Execution Environment
A C or C++ program specifies its exit code by returning that value from the main
function.There are other methods of providing exit codes, and special exit codes are assigned to programs that terminate abnormally (by a signal).These are discussedfurther in Chapter 3.
2.1.6 The Environment
GNU/Linux provides each running program with an environment .The environment is
a collection of variable/value pairs. Both environment variable names and their valuesare character strings. By convention, environment variable names are spelled in all capital letters.
Yo u’re probably familiar with several common environment variables already. For
instance:
nUSER contains your username.
nHOME contains the path to your home directory.
nPATH contains a colon-separated list of directories through which Linux searches
for commands you invoke.
nDISPLAY contains the name and display number of the X Window server on
which windows from graphical X Window programs will appear.
Y our shell, like any other program, has an environment. Shells provide methods forexamining and modifying the environment directly.T o print the current environmentin your shell, invoke the 
printenv program.Various shells have different built-in syntax
for using environment variables; the following is the syntax for Bourne-style shells.
nThe shell automatically creates a shell variable for each environment variablethat it finds, so you can access environment variable values using the 
$varname
syntax. For instance:
% echo $USERsamuel% echo $HOME/home/samuel
nY ou can use the export command to export a shell variable into the environ-
ment. For example, to set the EDITOR environment variable, you would use this:
% EDITOR=emacs% export EDITOR
Or, for short:
% export EDITOR=emacs03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 25
26 Chapter 2 Writing Good GNU/Linux Software
In a program, you access an environment variable with the getenv function in
<stdlib.h> .That function takes a variable name and returns the corresponding value
as a character string, or NULL if that variable is not defined in the environment.T o set
or clear environment variables, use the setenv and unsetenv functions, respectively.
Enumerating all the variables in the environment is a little trickier.T o do this, you
must access a special global variable named environ , which is defined in the GNU C
library.This variable, of type char** , is a NULL-terminated array of pointers to character
strings. Each string contains one environment variable, in the form VARIABLE=value .
The program in Listing 2.3, for instance, simply prints the entire environment by
looping through the environ array.
Listing 2.3 (print-env.c ) Printing the Execution Environment
#include <stdio.h>/* The ENVIRON variable contains the environment.  */extern char** environ;int main (){
char** var;for (var = environ; *var != NULL; ++var)
printf (“%s\n”, *var);
return 0;
}
Don’t modify environ yourself; use the setenv and unsetenv functions instead.
Usually, when a new program is started, it inherits a copy of the environment of
the program that invoked it (the shell program, if it was invoked interactively). So, forinstance, programs that you run from the shell may examine the values of environmentvariables that you set in the shell.
Environment variables are commonly used to communicate configuration informa-
tion to programs. Suppose, for example, that you are writing a program that connects toan Internet server to obtain some information.Y ou could write the program so that theserver name is specified on the command line. However, suppose that the server nameis not something that users will change very often.Y ou can use a special environmentvariable —say 
SERVER_NAME —to specify the server name; if that variable doesn ’t exist, a
default value is used. Part of your program might look as shown in Listing 2.4.
Listing 2.4 (client.c ) Part of a Network Client Program
#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>int main (){03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 26
27 2.1 Interaction With the Execution Environment
char* server_name = getenv (“SERVER_NAME”);if (server_name == NULL) 
/* The SERVER_NAME environment variable was not set.  Use the
default.  */
server_name = “server.my-company.com”;
printf (“accessing server %s\n”, server_name);/* Access the server here...  */return 0;
}
Suppose that this program is named client .Assuming that you haven ’t set the
SERVER_NAME variable, the default value for the server name is used:
% clientaccessing server server.my-company.com
But it ’s easy to specify a different server:
% export SERVER_NAME=backup-server.elsewhere.net% clientaccessing server backup-server.elsewhere.net
2.1.7 Using Temporary Files
Sometimes a program needs to make a temporary file, to store large data for a while orto pass data to another program. On GNU/Linux systems, temporary files are storedin the 
/tmp directory.When using temporary files, you should be aware of the follow-
ing pitfalls:
nMore than one instance of your program may be run simultaneously (by thesame user or by different users).The instances should use different temporaryfilenames so that they don ’t collide.
nThe file permissions of the temporary file should be set in such a way thatunauthorized users cannot alter the program ’s execution by modifying or 
replacing the temporary file.
nT emporary filenames should be generated in a way that cannot be predictedexternally; otherwise, an attacker can exploit the delay between testing whethera given name is already in use and opening a new temporary file.
GNU/Linux provides functions,
mkstemp and tmpfile , that take care of these issues for
you (in addition to several functions that don ’t).Which you use depends on whether
you plan to hand the temporary file to another program, and whether you want to useUNIX I/O (
open,write , and so on) or the C library ’s stream I/O functions ( fopen ,
fprintf , and so on).03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 27
28 Chapter 2 Writing Good GNU/Linux Software
Using mkstemp
The mkstemp function creates a unique temporary filename from a filename template,
creates the file with permissions so that only the current user can access it, and opensthe file for read/write.The filename template is a character string ending with“XXXXXX ”(six capital X ’s);
mkstemp replaces the X ’s with characters so that the file-
name is unique.The return value is a file descriptor; use the write family of functions
to write to the temporary file.
T emporary files created with mkstemp are not deleted automatically. It ’s up to you
to remove the temporary file when it ’s no longer needed. (Programmers should be
very careful to clean up temporary files; otherwise, the /tmp file system will fill up
eventually, rendering the system inoperable.) If the temporary file is for internal useonly and won ’t be handed to another program, it ’s a good idea to call 
unlink on the
temporary file immediately.The unlink function removes the directory entry corre-
sponding to a file, but because files in a file system are reference-counted, the file itselfis not removed until there are no open file descriptors for that file, either.This way,your program may continue to use the temporary file, and the file goes away automat-
ically as soon as you close the file descriptor. Because Linux closes file descriptorswhen a program ends, the temporary file will be removed even if your program termi-nates abnormally.
The pair of functions in Listing 2.5 demonstrates 
mkstemp . Used together, these
functions make it easy to write a memory buffer to a temporary file (so that memorycan be freed or reused) and then read it back later.
Listing 2.5 (temp_file.c ) Using mkstemp
#include <stdlib.h>#include <unistd.h>/* A handle for a temporary file created with write_temp_file.  In
this implementation, it’s just a file descriptor.  */
typedef int temp_file_handle;/* Writes LENGTH bytes from BUFFER into a temporary file.  The
temporary file is immediately unlinked.  Returns a handle to thetemporary file.  */
temp_file_handle write_temp_file (char* buffer, size_t length){
/* Create the filename and file.  The XXXXXX will be replaced with
characters that make the filename unique.  */
char temp_filename[] = “/tmp/temp_file.XXXXXX”;int fd = mkstemp (temp_filename);/* Unlink the file immediately, so that it will be removed when the
file descriptor is closed.  */
unlink (temp_filename);/* Write the number of bytes to the file first.  */write (fd, &length, sizeof (length));03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 28
29 2.1 Interaction With the Execution Environment
/* Now write the data itself.  */write (fd, buffer, length);/* Use the file descriptor as the handle for the temporary file.  */return fd;
}/* Reads the contents of a temporary file TEMP_FILE created with
write_temp_file.  The return value is a newly allocated buffer ofthose contents, which the caller must deallocate with free.*LENGTH is set to the size of the contents, in bytes.  Thetemporary file is removed.  */
char* read_temp_file (temp_file_handle temp_file, size_t* length){
char* buffer;/* The TEMP_FILE handle is a file descriptor to the temporary file.  */int fd = temp_file;/* Rewind to the beginning of the file.  */lseek (fd, 0, SEEK_SET);/* Read the size of the data in the temporary file.  */read (fd, length, sizeof (*length));/* Allocate a buffer and read the data.  */buffer = (char*) malloc (*length);read (fd, buffer, *length);/* Close the file descriptor, which will cause the temporary file to
go away.  */
close (fd);return buffer;
}
Using tmpfile
If you are using the C library I/O functions and don ’t need to pass the temporary file
to another program, you can use the tmpfile function.This creates and opens a tem-
porary file, and returns a file pointer to it.The temporary file is already unlinked, as inthe previous example, so it is deleted automatically when the file pointer is closed(with 
fclose ) or when the program terminates.
GNU/Linux provides several other functions for generating temporary files and tem-
porary filenames, including mktemp ,tmpnam , and tempnam .D o n ’t use these functions,
though, because they suffer from the reliability and security problems already mentioned.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 29

2.2 Coding Defensively
Writing programs that run correctly under “normal ”use is hard; writing programs that
behave gracefully in failure situations is harder.This section demonstrates some codingtechniques for finding bugs early and for detecting and recovering from problems in arunning program.
The code samples presented later in this book deliberately skip extensive error
checking and recovery code because this would obscure the basic functionality beingpresented. However, the final example in Chapter 11, “A Sample GNU/Linux
Application, ”comes back to demonstrating how to use these techniques to write
robust programs.
2.2.1 Using assert
A good objective to keep in mind when coding application programs is that bugs orunexpected errors should cause the program to fail dramatically, as early as possible.This will help you find bugs earlier in the development and testing cycles. Failures thatdon’t exhibit themselves dramatically are often missed and don ’t show up until the
application is in users ’hands.
One of the simplest methods to check for unexpected conditions is the standard C
assert macro.The argument to this macro is a Boolean expression.The program is
terminated if the expression evaluates to false, after printing an error message contain-ing the source file and line number and the text of the expression.The 
assert macro
is very useful for a wide variety of consistency checks internal to a program. Forinstance, use 
assert to test the validity of function arguments, to test preconditions
and postconditions of function calls (and method calls, in C++), and to test for unex-pected return values.
Each use of 
assert serves not only as a runtime check of a condition, but also as
documentation about the program ’s operation within the source code. If your program
contains an assert (condition ) that says to someone reading your source code that
condition should always be true at that point in the program, and if condition is not
true, it ’s probably a bug in the program.
For performance-critical code, runtime checks such as uses of assert can impose a
significant performance penalty. In these cases, you can compile your code with the
NDEBUG macro defined, by using the -DNDEBUG flag on your compiler command line.
With NDEBUG set, appearances of the assert macro will be preprocessed away. It ’s a
good idea to do this only when necessary for performance reasons, though, and onlywith performance-critical source files.
Because it is possible to preprocess 
assert macros away, be car eful that any expres-
sion you use with assert has no side effects. Specifically, you shouldn ’t call functions
inside assert expressions, assign variables, or use modifying operators such as ++.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 30
31 2.2 Coding Defensively
Suppose, for example, that you call a function, do_something , repeatedly in a loop.
The do_something function returns zero on success and nonzero on failure, but you
don’t expect it ever to fail in your program.Y ou might be tempted to write:
for (i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
assert (do_something () == 0);
However, you might find that this runtime check imposes too large a performancepenalty and decide later to recompile with 
NDEBUG defined.This will remove the
assert call entirely, so the expression will never be evaluated and do_something will
never be called.Y ou should write this instead:
for (i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
int status = do_something ();assert (status == 0);
}
Another thing to bear in mind is that you should not use assert to test for invalid
user input. Users don ’t like it when applications simply crash with a cryptic error mes-
sage, even in response to invalid input.Y ou should still always check for invalid inputand produce sensible error messages in response input. Use 
assert for internal run-
time checks only.
Some good places to use assert are these:
nCheck against null pointers, for instance, as invalid function arguments.The errormessage generated by {
assert (pointer !=  NULL)} ,
Assertion ‘pointer != ((void *)0)’ failed.
is more informative than the error message that would result if your programdereferenced a null pointer:
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
nCheck conditions on function parameter values. For instance, if a functionshould be called only with a positive value for parameter 
foo, use this at the
beginning of the function body:
assert (foo > 0);
This will help you detect misuses of the function, and it also makes it very clearto someone reading the function ’s source code that there is a restriction on the
parameter ’s value.
Don’t hold back; use 
assert liberally throughout your programs.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 31

2.2.2 System Call Failures
Most of us were originally taught how to write programs that execute to completionalong a well-defined path.We divide the program into tasks and subtasks, and eachfunction completes a task by invoking other functions to perform corresponding sub-tasks. Given appropriate inputs, we expect a function to produce the correct outputand side effects.
The realities of computer hardware and software intrude into this idealized dream.
Computers have limited resources; hardware fails; many programs execute at the sametime; users and programmers make mistakes. It ’s often at the boundary between the
application and the operating system that these realities exhibit themselves.Therefore,when using system calls to access system resources, to perform I/O, or for other pur-poses, it ’s important to understand not only what happens when the call succeeds, but
also how and when the call can fail.
System calls can fail in many ways. For example:
nThe system can run out of resources (or the program can exceed the resourcelimits enforced by the system of a single program). For example, the programmight try to allocate too much memory, to write too much to a disk, or to opentoo many files at the same time.
nLinux may block a certain system call when a program attempts to perform anoperation for which it does not have permission. For example, a program mightattempt to write to a file marked read-only, to access the memory of anotherprocess, or to kill another user ’s program.
nThe arguments to a system call might be invalid, either because the user pro-vided invalid input or because of a program bug. For instance, the programmight pass an invalid memory address or an invalid file descriptor to a systemcall. Or, a program might attempt to open a directory as an ordinary file, ormight pass the name of an ordinary file to a system call that expects a directory.
nA system call can fail for reasons external to a program.This happens most oftenwhen a system call accesses a hardware device.The device might be faulty ormight not support a particular operation, or perhaps a disk is not inserted in thedrive.
nA system call can sometimes be interrupted by an external event, such as thedelivery of a signal.This might not indicate outright failure, but it is the respon-sibility of the calling program to restart the system call, if desired.
In a well-written program that makes extensive use of system calls, it is often the casethat more code is devoted to detecting and handling errors and other exceptional cir-cumstances than to the main work of the program.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 32

2.2.3 Error Codes from System Calls
A majority of system calls return zero if the operation succeeds, or a nonzero value ifthe operation fails. (Many, though, have different return value conventions; forinstance,
malloc returns a null pointer to indicate failure.Always read the man page
carefully when using a system call.) Although this information may be enough todetermine whether the program should continue execution as usual, it probably doesnot provide enough information for a sensible recovery from errors.
Most system calls use a special variable named 
errno to store additional information
in case of failure.2When a call fails, the system sets errno to a value indicating what
went wrong. Because all system calls use the same errno variable to store error infor-
mation, you should copy the value into another variable immediately after the failedcall.The value of 
errno will be overwritten the next time you make a system call.
Error values are integers; possible values are given by preprocessor macros, by con-
vention named in all capitals and starting with “E”—for example, EACCES and EINVAL .
Always use these macros to refer to errno values rather than integer values. Include the
<errno.h> header if you use errno values.
GNU/Linux provides a convenient function, strerror , that returns a character
string description of an errno error code, suitable for use in error messages. Include
<string.h> if you use strerror .
GNU/Linux also provides perror , which prints the error description directly to
the stderr stream. Pass to perror a character string prefix to print before the error
description, which should usually include the name of the function that failed. Include
<stdio.h> if you use perror .
This code fragment attempts to open a file; if the open fails, it prints an error mes-
sage and exits the program. Note that the open call returns an open file descriptor if
the open operation succeeds, or –1 if the operation fails.
fd = open (“inputfile.txt”, O_RDONLY);if (fd == -1) {
/* The open failed.  Print an error message and exit.  */fprintf (stderr, “error opening file: %s\n”, strerror (errno));exit (1);
}
Depending on your program and the nature of the system call, the appropriate actionin case of failure might be to print an error message, to cancel an operation, to abortthe program, to try again, or even to ignore the error. It ’s important, though, to
include logic that handles all possible failure modes in some way or another.
2.Actually, for reasons of thread safety, errno is implemented as a macro, but it is used like a
global variable.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 33
34 Chapter 2 Writing Good GNU/Linux Software
One possible error code that you should be on the watch for, especially with I/O
functions, is EINTR . Some functions, such as read,select , and sleep , can take signifi-
cant time to execute.These are considered blocking functions because program execu-
tion is blocked until the call is completed. However, if the program receives a signalwhile blocked in one of these calls, the call will return without completing the opera-tion. In this case,
errno is set to EINTR . Usually, you ’ll want to retry the system call in
this case.
Here’s a code fragment that uses the chown call to change the owner of a file given
by path to the user by user_id . If the call fails, the program takes action depending on
the value of errno . Notice that when we detect what ’s probably a bug in the program,
we exit using abort or assert , which cause a core file to be generated.This can be
useful for post-mortem debugging. For other unrecoverable errors, such as out-of-memory conditions, we exit using 
exit and a nonzero exit value instead because a
core file wouldn ’t be very useful.
rval = chown (path, user_id, -1);if (rval != 0) {
/* Save errno because it’s clobbered by the next system call.  */int error_code = errno;/* The operation didn’t succeed; chown should return -1 on error.  */assert (rval == -1);/* Check the value of errno, and take appropriate action.  */switch (error_code) {case EPERM:         /* Permission denied.  */case EROFS:         /* PATH is on a read-only file system.  */case ENAMETOOLONG:  /* PATH is too long.  */case ENOENT:        /* PATH does not exit.  */case ENOTDIR:       /* A component of PATH is not a directory.  */case EACCES:        /* A component of PATH is not accessible.  */
/* Something’s wrong with the file.  Print an error message.  */fprintf (stderr, “error changing ownership of %s: %s\n”, 
path, strerror (error_code));
/* Don’t end the program; perhaps give the user a chance to
choose another file...  */
break;
case EFAULT: 
/* PATH contains an invalid memory address.  This is probably a bug.  */abort ();
case ENOMEM:
/* Ran out of kernel memory.  */fprintf (stderr, “%s\n”, strerror (error_code));exit (1);
default:
/* Some other, unexpected, error code.  We’ve tried to handle all
possible error codes; if we’ve missed one, that’s a bug!  */
abort ();
};
}03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 34
35 2.2 Coding Defensively
Y ou could simply have used this code, which behaves the same way if the call succeeds:
rval = chown (path, user_id, -1);assert (rval == 0);
But if the call fails, this alternative makes no effort to report, handle, or recover fromerrors.
Whether you use the first form, the second form, or something in between
depends on the error detection and recovery requirements for your program.
2.2.4 Errors and Resource Allocation
Often, when a system call fails, it ’s appropriate to cancel the current operation but not
to terminate the program because it may be possible to recover from the error. Oneway to do this is to return from the current function, passing a return code to thecaller indicating the error.
If you decide to return from the middle of a function, it ’s important to make sure
that any resources successfully allocated previously in the function are first deallocated.These resources can include memory, file descriptors, file pointers, temporary files,synchronization objects, and so on. Otherwise, if your program continues running, theresources allocated before the failure occurred will be leaked.
Consider, for example, a function that reads from a file into a buffer.The function
might follow these steps:
1. Allocate the buffer.2. Open the file.3. Read from the file into the buffer.4. Close the file.5. Return the buffer.
If the file doesn ’t exist, Step 2 will fail.An appropriate course of action might be to
return 
NULL from the function. However, if the buffer has already been allocated in
Step 1, there is a risk of leaking that memory.Y ou must remember to deallocate thebuffer somewhere along any flow of control from which you don ’t return. If Step 3
fails, not only must you deallocate the buffer before returning, but you also must closethe file.
Listing 2.6 shows an example of how you might write this function.
Listing 2.6 (readfile.c ) Freeing Resources During Abnormal Conditions
#include <fcntl.h>#include <stdlib.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>
continues03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 35
36 Chapter 2 Writing Good GNU/Linux Software
char* read_from_file (const char* filename, size_t length){
char* buffer;int fd;ssize_t bytes_read;/* Allocate the buffer.  */buffer = (char*) malloc (length);if (buffer == NULL)
return NULL;
/* Open the file.  */fd = open (filename, O_RDONLY);if (fd == -1) {
/* open failed.  Deallocate buffer before returning.  */free (buffer);return NULL;
}/* Read the data.  */bytes_read = read (fd, buffer, length);if (bytes_read != length) {
/* read failed.  Deallocate buffer and close fd before returning.  */free (buffer);close (fd);return NULL;
}/* Everything’s fine.  Close the file and return the buffer.  */close (fd);return buffer;
}
Linux cleans up allocated memory, open files, and most other resources when a pro-gram terminates, so it ’s not necessary to deallocate buffers and close files before calling
exit.Y ou might need to manually free other shared resources, however, such as tempo-
rary files and shared memory, which can potentially outlive a program.
2.3 Writing and Using Libraries
Virtually all programs are linked against one or more libraries.Any program that uses aC function (such as 
printf or malloc ) will be linked against the C runtime library. If
your program has a graphical user interface (GUI), it will be linked against windowinglibraries. If your program uses a database, the database provider will give you librariesthat you can use to access the database conveniently.
In each of these cases, you must decide whether to link the library statically or
dynamically . If you choose to link statically, your programs will be bigger and harder to
upgrade, but probably easier to deploy. If you link dynamically, your programs will beListing 2.6 Continued03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 36
37 2.3 Writing and Using Libraries
smaller, easier to upgrade, but harder to deploy.This section explains how to link bothstatically and dynamically, examines the trade-offs in more detail, and gives some “rules
of thumb ”for deciding which kind of linking is better for you.
2.3.1 Archives
An archive (or static library) is simply a collection of object files stored as a single file.
(An archive is roughly the equivalent of a Windows .LIB file.) When you provide an
archive to the linker, the linker searches the archive for the object files it needs,extracts them, and links them into your program much as if you had provided thoseobject files directly.
Y ou can create an archive using the 
arcommand.Archive files traditionally use a .a
extension rather than the .o extension used by ordinary object files. Here ’s how you
would combine test1.o and test2.o into a single libtest.a archive:
% ar cr libtest.a test1.o test2.o
The crflags tell arto create the archive.3Now you can link with this archive using
the -ltest option with gccor g++, as described in Section 1.2.2, “Linking Object
Files,”in Chapter 1, “Getting Started. ”
When the linker encounters an archive on the command line, it searches the
archive for all definitions of symbols (functions or variables) that are referenced fromthe object files that it has already processed but not yet defined.The object files thatdefine those symbols are extracted from the archive and included in the final exe-cutable. Because the linker searches the archive when it is encountered on the com-mand line, it usually makes sense to put archives at the end of the command line. Forexample, suppose that 
test.c contains the code in Listing 2.7 and app.c contains the
code in Listing 2.8.
Listing 2.7 (test.c) Library Contents
int f () {
return 3;
}
Listing 2.8 (app.c) A Program That Uses Library Functions
int main () {
return f ();
}
3.Y ou can use other flags to remove a file from an archive or to perform other operations on
the archive.These operations are rarely used but are documented on the arman page.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 37
38 Chapter 2 Writing Good GNU/Linux Software
Now suppose that test.o is combined with some other object files to produce the
libtest.a archive.The following command line will not work:
% gcc -o app -L. -ltest app.oapp.o: In function ‘main’:app.o(.text+0x4): undefined reference to ‘f’collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
The error message indicates that even though libtest.a contains a definition of f, the
linker did not find it.That ’s because libtest.a was searched when it was first encoun-
tered, and at that point the linker hadn ’t seen any references to f.
On the other hand, if we use this line, no error messages are issued:
% gcc -o app app.o -L. –ltest
The reason is that the reference to fin app.o causes the linker to include the test.o
object file from the libtest.a archive.
2.3.2 Shared Libraries
A shared library (also known as a shared object, or as a dynamically linked library) is
similar to a archive in that it is a grouping of object files. However, there are manyimportant differences.The most fundamental difference is that when a shared library islinked into a program, the final executable does not actually contain the code that ispresent in the shared library. Instead, the executable merely contains a reference to theshared library. If several programs on the system are linked against the same sharedlibrary, they will all reference the library, but none will actually be included.Thus, thelibrary is “shared ”among all the programs that link with it.
A second important difference is that a shared library is not merely a collection of
object files, out of which the linker chooses those that are needed to satisfy undefinedreferences. Instead, the object files that compose the shared library are combined into asingle object file so that a program that links against a shared library always includes allof the code in the library, rather than just those portions that are needed.
T o create a shared library, you must compile the objects that will make up the
library using the 
-fPIC option to the compiler, like this:
% gcc -c -fPIC test1.c
The -fPIC option tells the compiler that you are going to be using test.o as part of a
shared object.
Position-Independent Code (PIC)
PIC stands for position-independent code. The functions in a shared library may be loaded at differentaddresses in different programs, so the code in the shared object must not depend on the address (orposition) at which it is loaded. This consideration has no impact on you, as the programmer, except thatyou must remember to use the 
-fPIC flag when compiling code that will be used in a shared library.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 38
39 2.3 Writing and Using Libraries
Then you combine the object files into a shared library, like this:
% gcc -shared -fPIC -o libtest.so test1.o test2.o
The -shared option tells the linker to produce a shared library rather than an ordinary
executable. Shared libraries use the extension .so, which stands for shared object. Like
static archives, the name always begins with lib to indicate that the file is a library.
Linking with a shared library is just like linking with a static archive. For example,
the following line will link with libtest.so if it is in the current directory, or one of
the standard library search directories on the system:
% gcc -o app app.o -L. –ltest
Suppose that both libtest.a and libtest.so are available.Then the linker must
choose one of the libraries and not the other.The linker searches each directory (firstthose specified with 
-Loptions, and then those in the standard directories).When the
linker finds a directory that contains either libtest.a or libtest.so , the linker stops
search directories. If only one of the two variants is present in the directory, the linkerchooses that variant. Otherwise, the linker chooses the shared library version, unlessyou explicitly instruct it otherwise.Y ou can use the 
-static option to demand static
archives. For example, the following line will use the libtest.a archive, even if the
libtest.so shared library is also available:
% gcc -static -o app app.o -L. –ltest
The lddcommand displays the shared libraries that are linked into an executable.
These libraries need to be available when the executable is run. Note that lddwill list
an additional library called ld-linux.so , which is a part of GNU/Linux ’s dynamic
linking mechanism.Using LD_LIBRARY_PATH
When you link a program with a shared library, the linker does not put the full pathto the shared library in the resulting executable. Instead, it places only the name of theshared library.When the program is actually run, the system searches for the sharedlibrary and loads it.The system searches only 
/lib and /usr/lib , by default. If a shared
library that is linked into your program is installed outside those directories, it will notbe found, and the system will refuse to run the program.
One solution to this problem is to use the 
-Wl,-rpath option when linking the
program. Suppose that you use this:
% gcc -o app app.o -L. -ltest -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib 
Then, when appis run, the system will search /usr/local/lib for any required shared
libraries.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 39
40 Chapter 2 Writing Good GNU/Linux Software
Another solution to this problem is to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment 
variable when running the program. Like the PATH environment variable,
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a colon-separated list of directories. For example, if
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is /usr/local/lib:/opt/lib , then /usr/local/lib and /opt/lib
will be searched before the standard /lib and /usr/lib directories.Y ou should also
note that if you have LD_LIBRARY_PATH , the linker will search the directories given
there in addition to the directories given with the -Loption when it is building an
executable.4
2.3.3 Standard Libraries
Even if you didn ’t specify any libraries when you linked your program, it almost cer-
tainly uses a shared library.That ’s because GCC automatically links in the standard C
library,libc, for you.The standard C library math functions are not included in libc;
instead, they ’re in a separate library, libm, which you need to specify explicitly. For
example, to compile and link a program compute.c which uses trigonometric func-
tions such as sin and cos, you must invoke this code:
% gcc -o compute compute.c –lm
If you write a C++ program and link it using the c++or g++commands, you ’ll also
get the standard C++ library, libstdc++ , automatically.
2.3.4 Library Dependencies
One library will often depend on another library. For example, many GNU/Linuxsystems include
libtiff , a library that contains functions for reading and writing
image files in the TIFF format.This library, in turn, uses the libraries libjpeg (JPEG
image routines) and libz (compression routines).
Listing 2.9 shows a very small program that uses libtiff to open a TIFF image file.
Listing 2.9 ( tifftest.c ) Using libtiff
#include <stdio.h>#include <tiffio.h>int main (int argc, char** argv){
TIFF* tiff;tiff = TIFFOpen (argv[1], “r”);TIFFClose (tiff);return 0;
}
4.Y ou might see a reference to LD_RUN_PATH in some online documentation. Don ’t believe
what you read; this variable does not actually do anything under GNU/Linux.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 40
41 2.3 Writing and Using Libraries
Save this source file as tifftest.c .T o compile this program and link with libtiff ,
specify -ltiff on your link line:
% gcc -o tifftest tifftest.c –ltiff
By default, this will pick up the shared-library version of libtiff , found at 
/usr/lib/libtiff.so . Because libtiff uses libjpeg and libz, the shared-library 
versions of these two are also drawn in (a shared library can point to other sharedlibraries that it depends on).T o verify this, use the 
lddcommand:
% ldd tifftest
libtiff.so.3 => /usr/lib/libtiff.so.3 (0x4001d000)libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40060000)libjpeg.so.62 => /usr/lib/libjpeg.so.62 (0x40155000)libz.so.1 => /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x40174000)/lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
Static libraries, on the other hand, cannot point to other libraries. If decide to linkwith the static version of 
libtiff by specifying -static on your command line, you
will encounter unresolved symbols:
% gcc -static -o tifftest tifftest.c -ltiff/usr/bin/../lib/libtiff.a(tif_jpeg.o): In function ‘TIFFjpeg_error_exit’:tif_jpeg.o(.text+0x2a): undefined reference to ‘jpeg_abort’/usr/bin/../lib/libtiff.a(tif_jpeg.o): In function ‘TIFFjpeg_create_compress’:tif_jpeg.o(.text+0x8d): undefined reference to ‘jpeg_std_error’tif_jpeg.o(.text+0xcf): undefined reference to ‘jpeg_CreateCompress’...
T o link this program statically, you must specify the other two libraries yourself:
% gcc -static -o tifftest tifftest.c -ltiff -ljpeg -lz
Occasionally, two libraries will be mutually dependent. In other words, the first archivewill reference symbols defined in the second archive, and vice versa.This situationgenerally arises out of poor design, but it does occasionally arise. In this case, you canprovide a single library multiple times on the command line.The linker will researchthe library each time it occurs. For example, this line will cause 
libfoo.a to be
searched multiple times:
% gcc -o app app.o -lfoo -lbar –lfoo
So, even if libfoo.a references symbols in libbar.a , and vice versa, the program will
link successfully.
2.3.5 Pros and Cons
Now that you know all about static archives and shared libraries, you ’re probably 
wondering which to use.There are a few major considerations to keep in mind.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 41
42 Chapter 2 Writing Good GNU/Linux Software
One major advantage of a shared library is that it saves space on the system where
the program is installed. If you are installing 10 programs, and they all make use of thesame shared library, then you save a lot of space by using a shared library. If you used astatic archive instead, the archive is included in all 10 programs. So, using sharedlibraries saves disk space. It also reduces download times if your program is beingdownloaded from the Web.
A related advantage to shared libraries is that users can upgrade the libraries with-
out upgrading all the programs that depend on them. For example, suppose that youproduce a shared library that manages HTTP connections. Many programs mightdepend on this library. If you find a bug in this library, you can upgrade the library.Instantly, all the programs that depend on the library will be fixed; you don ’t have to
relink all the programs the way you do with a static archive.
Those advantages might make you think that you should always use shared
libraries. However, substantial reasons exist to use static archives instead.The fact thatan upgrade to a shared library affects all programs that depend on it can be a disadvan-tage. For example, if you ’re developing mission-critical software, you might rather link
to a static archive so that an upgrade to shared libraries on the system won ’t affect
your program. (Otherwise, users might upgrade the shared library, thereby breakingyour program, and then call your customer support line, blaming you!)
If you ’re not going to be able to install your libraries in 
/lib or /usr/lib ,y o u
should definitely think twice about using a shared library. (Y ou won ’t be able to install
your libraries in those directories if you expect users to install your software withoutadministrator privileges.) In particular, the 
-Wl,-rpath trick won ’t work if you don ’t
know where the libraries are going to end up.And asking your users to set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH means an extra step for them. Because each user has to do this 
individually, this is a substantial additional burden.
Yo u’ll have to weigh these advantages and disadvantages for every program you
distribute.
2.3.6 Dynamic Loading and Unloading
Sometimes you might want to load some code at run time without explicitly linkingin that code. For example, consider an application that supports “plug-in ”modules,
such as a Web browser.The browser allows third-party developers to create plug-ins toprovide additional functionality.The third-party developers create shared libraries andplace them in a known location.The Web browser then automatically loads the codein these libraries.
This functionality is available under Linux by using the 
dlopen function.Y ou could
open a shared library named libtest.so by calling dlopen like this:
dlopen (“libtest.so”, RTLD_LAZY)03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 42
43 2.3 Writing and Using Libraries
(The second parameter is a flag that indicates how to bind symbols in the sharedlibrary.Y ou can consult the online man pages for 
dlopen if you want more informa-
tion, but RTLD_LAZY is usually the setting that you want.) T o use dynamic loading func-
tions, include the <dlfcn.h> header file and link with the –ldl option to pick up the
libdl library.
The return value from this function is a void * that is used as a handle for the
shared library.Y ou can pass this value to the dlsym function to obtain the address of a
function that has been loaded with the shared library. For example, if libtest.so
defines a function named my_function , you could call it like this:
void* handle = dlopen (“libtest.so”, RTLD_LAZY);void (*test)() = dlsym (handle, “my_function”);(*test)();dlclose (handle);
The dlsym system call can also be used to obtain a pointer to a static variable in the
shared library.
Both dlopen and dlsym return NULL if they do not succeed. In that event, you 
can call dlerror (with no parameters) to obtain a human-readable error message
describing the problem.
The dlclose function unloads the shared library.T echnically, dlopen actually loads
the library only if it is not already loaded. If the library has already been loaded,
dlopen simply increments the library reference count. Similarly, dlclose decrements
the reference count and then unloads the library only if the reference count hasreached zero.
If you ’re writing the code in your shared library in C++, you will probably want 
to declare those functions and variables that you plan to access elsewhere with the
extern “C” linkage specifier. For instance, if the C++ function my_function is in a
shared library and you want to access it with dlsym , you should declare it like this:
extern “C” void foo ();
This prevents the C++ compiler from mangling the function name, which wouldchange the function ’s name from 
footo a different, funny-looking name that encodes
extra information about the function.A C compiler will not mangle names; it will usewhichever name you give to your function or variable.03 0430 CH02  5/22/01  10:20 AM  Page 43

Processes
3
A RUNNING INSTANCE OF A PROGRAM IS CALLED A PROCESS . If you have two 
terminal windows showing on your screen, then you are probably running the same terminal program twice —you have two terminal processes. Each terminal 
window is probably running a shell; each running shell is another process.When youinvoke a command from a shell, the corresponding program is executed in a newprocess; the shell process resumes when that process completes.
Advanced programmers often use multiple cooperating processes in a single appli-
cation to enable the application to do more than one thing at once, to increase application robustness, and to make use of already-existing programs.
Most of the process manipulation functions described in this chapter are similar to
those on other UNIX systems. Most are declared in the header file 
<unistd.h> ; check
the man page for each function to be sure.
3.1 Looking at Processes
Even as you sit down at your computer, there are processes running. Every executingprogram uses one or more processes. Let ’s start by taking a look at the processes
already on your computer.04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 45
46 Chapter 3 Processes
3.1.1 Process IDs
Each process in a Linux system is identified by its unique process ID , sometimes
referred to as pid. Process IDs are 16-bit numbers that are assigned sequentially by
Linux as new processes are created.
Every process also has a parent process (except the special init process, described in
Section 3.4.3, “Zombie Processes ”).Thus, you can think of the processes on a Linux
system as arranged in a tree, with the init process at its root.The parent process ID ,o r
ppid, is simply the process ID of the process ’s parent.
When referring to process IDs in a C or C++ program, always use the pid_t
typedef, which is defined in <sys/types.h> .A program can obtain the process ID of
the process it ’s running in with the getpid() system call, and it can obtain the process
ID of its parent process with the getppid() system call. For instance, the program in
Listing 3.1 prints its process ID and its parent ’s process ID.
Listing 3.1 (print-pid.c ) Printing the Process ID
#include <stdio.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (){
printf (“The process ID is %d\n”, (int) getpid ());printf (“The parent process ID is %d\n”, (int) getppid ());return 0;
}
Observe that if you invoke this program several times, a different process ID isreported because each invocation is in a new process. However, if you invoke it everytime from the same shell, the parent process ID (that is, the process ID of the shellprocess) is the same.
3.1.2 Viewing Active Processes
The pscommand displays the processes that are running on your system.The
GNU/Linux version of pshas lots of options because it tries to be compatible with
versions of pson several other UNIX variants.These options control which processes
are listed and what information about each is shown.
By default, invoking psdisplays the processes controlled by the terminal or terminal
window in which psis invoked. For example:
% ps
PID TTY          TIME CMD
21693 pts/8    00:00:00 bash21694 pts/8    00:00:00 ps04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 46
47 3.1 Looking at Processes
This invocation of psshows two processes.The first, bash, is the shell running on this
terminal.The second is the running instance of the psprogram itself.The first col-
umn, labeled PID, displays the process ID of each.
For a more detailed look at what ’s running on your GNU/Linux system, invoke
this:
% ps -e -o pid,ppid,command
The -eoption instructs psto display all processes running on the system.The
-o pid,ppid,command option tells pswhat information to show about each process —
in this case, the process ID, the parent process ID, and the command running in thisprocess.
psOutput Formats
With the -ooption to the pscommand, you specify the information about processes that you want in
the output as a comma-separated list. For example, ps -o pid,user,start_time,command displays
the process ID, the name of the user owning the process, the wall clock time at which the processstarted, and the command running in the process. See the man page for 
psfor the full list of field codes.
You can use the -f(full listing), -l(long listing), or -j(jobs listing) options instead to get three differ-
ent preset listing formats.
Here are the first few lines and last few lines of output from this command on my system.Y ou may see different output, depending on what ’s running on your system.
% ps -e -o pid,ppid,command
PID  PPID COMMAND
1     0 init [5]2     1 [kflushd]3     1 [kupdate]
...21725 21693 xterm21727 21725 bash21728 21727 ps -e -o pid,ppid,command
Note that the parent process ID of the pscommand, 21727, is the process ID of bash,
the shell from which I invoked ps.The parent process ID of bash is in turn 21725, the
process ID of the xterm program in which the shell is running.
3.1.3 Killing a Process
Y ou can kill a running process with the kill command. Simply specify on the com-
mand line the process ID of the process to be killed.
The kill command works by sending the process a SIGTERM , or termination,
signal.1This causes the process to terminate, unless the executing program explicitly
handles or masks the SIGTERM signal. Signals are described in Section 3.3, “Signals. ”
1.Y ou can also use the kill command to send other signals to a process.This is described in
Section 3.4, “Process T ermination. ”04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 47

3.2 Creating Processes
T wo common techniques are used for creating a new process.The first is relativelysimple but should be used sparingly because it is inefficient and has considerably security risks.The second technique is more complex but provides greater flexibility,speed, and security.
3.2.1 Using system
The system function in the standard C library provides an easy way to execute a 
command from within a program, much as if the command had been typed into ashell. In fact,
system creates a subprocess running the standard Bourne shell ( /bin/sh )
and hands the command to that shell for execution. For example, this program inListing 3.2 invokes the 
lscommand to display the contents of the root directory, as if
you typed ls -l / into a shell.
Listing 3.2 (system.c ) Using the system Call
#include <stdlib.h>int main (){
int return_value;return_value = system (“ls -l /”);return return_value;
}
The system function returns the exit status of the shell command. If the shell itself
cannot be run, system returns 127; if another error occurs, system returns –1.
Because the system function uses a shell to invoke your command, it ’s subject to
the features, limitations, and security flaws of the system ’s shell.Y ou can ’t rely on the
availability of any particular version of the Bourne shell. On many UNIX systems,
/bin/sh is a symbolic link to another shell. For instance, on most GNU/Linux sys-
tems,/bin/sh points to bash (the Bourne-Again SHell), and different GNU/Linux
distributions use different versions of bash. Invoking a program with root privilege
with the system function, for instance, can have different results on different
GNU/Linux systems.Therefore, it ’s preferable to use the fork and exec method for
creating processes.
3.2.2 Using forkand exec
The DOS and Windows API contains the spawn family of functions.These functions
take as an argument the name of a program to run and create a new process instanceof that program. Linux doesn ’t contain a single function that does all this in one step.
Instead, Linux provides one function,
fork, that makes a child process that is an exact04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 48
49 3.2 Creating Processes
copy of its parent process. Linux provides another set of functions, the exec family, that
causes a particular process to cease being an instance of one program and to insteadbecome an instance of another program.T o spawn a new process, you first use 
fork to
make a copy of the current process.Then you use exec to transform one of these
processes into an instance of the program you want to spawn.Calling fork
When a program calls 
fork, a duplicate process, called the child process , is created.The
parent process continues executing the program from the point that fork was called.
The child process, too, executes the same program from the same place.
So how do the two processes differ? First, the child process is a new process and
therefore has a new process ID, distinct from its parent ’s process ID. One way for a
program to distinguish whether it ’s in the parent process or the child process is to call
getpid . However, the fork function provides different return values to the parent and
child processes —one process “goes in ”to the fork call, and two processes “come out, ”
with different return values.The return value in the parent process is the process ID ofthe child.The return value in the child process is zero. Because no process ever has aprocess ID of zero, this makes it easy for the program whether it is now running as theparent or the child process.
Listing 3.3 is an example of using 
fork to duplicate a program ’s process. Note that
the first block of the ifstatement is executed only in the parent process, while the
else clause is executed in the child process.
Listing 3.3 (fork.c) Using forkto Duplicate a Program ’s Process
#include <stdio.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (){
pid_t child_pid;printf (“the main program process ID is %d\n”, (int) getpid ());child_pid = fork ();if (child_pid != 0) {
printf (“this is the parent process, with id %d\n”, (int) getpid ());printf (“the child’s process ID is %d\n”, (int) child_pid);
}else 
printf (“this is the child process, with id %d\n”, (int) getpid ());
return 0;
}04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 49
50 Chapter 3 Processes
Using the execFamily
The exec functions replace the program running in a process with another program.
When a program calls an exec function, that process immediately ceases executing that
program and begins executing a new program from the beginning, assuming that the
exec call doesn ’t encounter an error.
Within the exec family, there are functions that vary slightly in their capabilities
and how they are called.
nFunctions that contain the letter pin their names ( execvp and execlp ) accept a
program name and search for a program by that name in the current executionpath; functions that don ’t contain the pmust be given the full path of the pro-
gram to be executed.
nFunctions that contain the letter vin their names ( execv ,execvp , and execve )
accept the argument list for the new program as a NULL-terminated array ofpointers to strings. Functions that contain the letter l(
execl ,execlp , and
execle ) accept the argument list using the C language ’s varargs mechanism.
nFunctions that contain the letter ein their names ( execve and execle ) accept an
additional argument, an array of environment variables.The argument should bea NULL-terminated array of pointers to character strings. Each character stringshould be of the form “
VARIABLE=value ”.
Because exec replaces the calling program with another one, it never returns unless an
error occurs.
The argument list passed to the program is analogous to the command-line argu-
ments that you specify to a program when you run it from the shell.They are availablethrough the 
argc and argv parameters to main. Remember, when a program is
invoked from the shell, the shell sets the first element of the argument list argv[0] ) to
the name of the program, the second element of the argument list ( argv[1] ) to the
first command-line argument, and so on.When you use an exec function in your pro-
grams, you, too, should pass the name of the function as the first element of the argu-ment list.Using forkand execTogether
A common pattern to run a subprogram within a program is first to fork the processand then exec the subprogram.This allows the calling program to continue executionin the parent process while the calling program is replaced by the subprogram in thechild process.
The program in Listing 3.4, like Listing 3.2, lists the contents of the root directory
using the 
lscommand. Unlike the previous example, though, it invokes the lscom-
mand directly, passing it the command-line arguments -land /rather than invoking it
through a shell.04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 50

52 Chapter 3 Processes
3.2.3 Process Scheduling
Linux schedules the parent and child processes independently; there ’s no guarantee of
which one will run first, or how long it will run before Linux interrupts it and lets theother process (or some other process on the system) run. In particular, none, part, or allof the 
lscommand may run in the child process before the parent completes.2Linux
promises that each process will run eventually —no process will be completely starved
of execution resources.
Y ou may specify that a process is less important —and should be given a lower priority
—by assigning it a higher niceness value. By default, every process has a niceness of zero.
A higher niceness value means that the process is given a lesser execution priority;conversely, a process with a lower (that is, negative) niceness gets more execution time.
T o run a program with a nonzero niceness, use the 
nice command, specifying the
niceness value with the -noption. For example, this is how you might invoke the
command “sort input.txt > output.txt ”, a long sorting operation, with a reduced
priority so that it doesn ’t slow down the system too much:
% nice -n 10 sort input.txt > output.txt
Y ou can use the renice command to change the niceness of a running process from
the command line.
T o change the niceness of a running process programmatically, use the nice func-
tion. Its argument is an increment value, which is added to the niceness value of theprocess that calls it. Remember that a positive value raises the niceness value and thusreduces the process ’s execution priority.
Note that only a process with root privilege can run a process with a negative nice-
ness value or reduce the niceness value of a running process.This means that you mayspecify negative values to the 
nice and renice commands only when logged in as
root, and only a process running as root can pass a negative value to the nice function.
This prevents ordinary users from grabbing execution priority away from others using
the system.
3.3 Signals
Signals are mechanisms for communicating with and manipulating processes in Linux.
The topic of signals is a large one; here we discuss some of the most important signalsand techniques that are used for controlling processes.
A signal is a special message sent to a process. Signals are asynchronous; when a
process receives a signal, it processes the signal immediately, without finishing the cur-rent function or even the current line of code.There are several dozen different sig-nals, each with a different meaning. Each signal type is specified by its signal number,but in programs, you usually refer to a signal by its name. In Linux, these are definedin 
/usr/include/bits/signum.h . (Y ou shouldn ’t include this header file directly in
your programs; instead, use <signal.h> .)
2.A method for serializing the two processes is presented in Section 3.4.1, “Waiting for
Process T ermination. ”04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 52
53 3.3 Signals
When a process receives a signal, it may do one of several things, depending on the
signal ’s disposition . For each signal, there is a default disposition , which determines what
happens to the process if the program does not specify some other behavior. For mostsignal types, a program may specify some other behavior —either to ignore the signal
or to call a special signal-handler function to respond to the signal. If a signal handler is
used, the currently executing program is paused, the signal handler is executed, and,when the signal handler returns, the program resumes.
The Linux system sends signals to processes in response to specific conditions. For
instance,
SIGBUS (bus error), SIGSEGV (segmentation violation), and SIGFPE (floating
point exception) may be sent to a process that attempts to perform an illegal opera-tion.The default disposition for these signals it to terminate the process and produce acore file.
A process may also send a signal to another process. One common use of this
mechanism is to end another process by sending it a 
SIGTERM or SIGKILL signal.3
Another common use is to send a command to a running program.T wo “user-
defined ”signals are reserved for this purpose: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 .The SIGHUP signal
is sometimes used for this purpose as well, commonly to wake up an idling programor cause a program to reread its configuration files.
The 
sigaction function can be used to set a signal disposition.The first parameter
is the signal number.The next two parameters are pointers to sigaction structures; the
first of these contains the desired disposition for that signal number, while the secondreceives the previous disposition.The most important field in the first or second
sigaction structure is sa_handler . It can take one of three values:
nSIG_DFL , which specifies the default disposition for the signal.
nSIG_IGN , which specifies that the signal should be ignored.
nA pointer to a signal-handler function.The function should take one parameter,the signal number, and return 
void.
Because signals are asynchronous, the main program may be in a very fragile statewhen a signal is processed and thus while a signal handler function executes.Therefore, you should avoid performing any I/O operations or calling most libraryand system functions from signal handlers.
A signal handler should perform the minimum work necessary to respond to the
signal, and then return control to the main program (or terminate the program). Inmost cases, this consists simply of recording the fact that a signal occurred.The mainprogram then checks periodically whether a signal has occurred and reacts accordingly.
It is possible for a signal handler to be interrupted by the delivery of another signal.
While this may sound like a rare occurrence, if it does occur, it will be very difficult todiagnose and debug the problem. (This is an example of a race condition, discussed inChapter 4, “Threads, ”Section 4.4, “Synchronization and Critical Sections. ”) Therefore,
you should be very careful about what your program does in a signal handler.
3.What ’s the difference? The SIGTERM signal asks a process to terminate; the process may
ignore the request by masking or ignoring the signal.The SIGKILL signal always kills the process
immediately because the process may not mask or ignore SIGKILL .04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 53
54 Chapter 3 Processes
Even assigning a value to a global variable can be dangerous because the assignment
may actually be carried out in two or more machine instructions, and a second signalmay occur between them, leaving the variable in a corrupted state. If you use a globalvariable to flag a signal from a signal-handler function, it should be of the special type
sig_atomic_t . Linux guarantees that assignments to variables of this type are per-
formed in a single instruction and therefore cannot be interrupted midway. In Linux,
sig_atomic_t is an ordinary int; in fact, assignments to integer types the size of intor
smaller, or to pointers, are atomic. If you want to write a program that ’s portable to
any standard UNIX system, though, use sig_atomic_t for these global variables.
This program skeleton in Listing 3.5, for instance, uses a signal-handler function to
count the number of times that the program receives SIGUSR1 , one of the signals
reserved for application use.
Listing 3.5 (sigusr1.c ) Using a Signal Handler
#include <signal.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>sig_atomic_t sigusr1_count = 0;void handler (int signal_number){
++sigusr1_count;
}int main (){
struct sigaction sa;memset (&sa, 0, sizeof (sa));sa.sa_handler = &handler;sigaction (SIGUSR1, &sa, NULL);/* Do some lengthy stuff here.  *//* ...  */printf (“SIGUSR1 was raised %d times\n”, sigusr1_count);return 0;
}04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 54
55 3.4 Process Termination
3.4 Process Termination
Normally, a process terminates in one of two ways. Either the executing program callsthe 
exit function, or the program ’s main function returns. Each process has an exit
code: a number that the process returns to its parent.The exit code is the argumentpassed to the 
exit function, or the value returned from main.
A process may also terminate abnormally, in response to a signal. For instance, the
SIGBUS ,SIGSEGV , and SIGFPE signals mentioned previously cause the process to termi-
nate. Other signals are used to terminate a process explicitly.The SIGINT signal is sent
to a process when the user attempts to end it by typing Ctrl+C in its terminal.The
SIGTERM signal is sent by the kill command.The default disposition for both of these
is to terminate the process. By calling the abort function, a process sends itself the
SIGABRT signal, which terminates the process and produces a core file.The most pow-
erful termination signal is SIGKILL , which ends a process immediately and cannot be
blocked or handled by a program.
Any of these signals can be sent using the kill command by specifying an extra
command-line flag; for instance, to end a troublesome process by sending it a SIGKILL ,
invoke the following, where pidis its process ID:
% kill -KILL pid
T o send a signal from a program, use the kill function.The first parameter is the tar-
get process ID.The second parameter is the signal number; use SIGTERM to simulate the
default behavior of the kill command. For instance, where child pid contains the
process ID of the child process, you can use the kill function to terminate a child
process from the parent by calling it like this:
kill (child_pid, SIGTERM);
Include the <sys/types.h> and <signal.h> headers if you use the kill function.
By convention, the exit code is used to indicate whether the program executed
correctly.An exit code of zero indicates correct execution, while a nonzero exit codeindicates that an error occurred. In the latter case, the particular value returned maygive some indication of the nature of the error. It ’s a good idea to stick with this con-
vention in your programs because other components of the GNU/Linux systemassume this behavior. For instance, shells assume this convention when you connectmultiple programs with the 
&&(logical and) and ||(logical or) operators.Therefore,
you should explicitly return zero from your main function, unless an error occurs.04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 55
56 Chapter 3 Processes
With most shells, it ’s possible to obtain the exit code of the most recently executed
program using the special $?variable. Here ’s an example in which the lscommand is
invoked twice and its exit code is displayed after each invocation. In the first case, ls
executes correctly and returns the exit code zero. In the second case, lsencounters an
error (because the filename specified on the command line does not exist) and thusreturns a nonzero exit code.
% ls /bin   coda  etc   lib         misc  nfs  proc  sbin  usrboot  dev   home  lost+found  mnt   opt  root  tmp   var% echo $?0% ls bogusfilels: bogusfile: No such file or directory% echo $?1
Note that even though the parameter type of the exit function is intand the main
function returns an int, Linux does not preserve the full 32 bits of the return code. In
fact, you should use exit codes only between zero and 127. Exit codes above 128 havea special meaning —when a process is terminated by a signal, its exit code is 128 plus
the signal number.
3.4.1 Waiting for Process Termination
If you typed in and ran the fork and exec example in Listing 3.4, you may have
noticed that the output from the lsprogram often appears after the “main program ”
has already completed.That ’s because the child process, in which lsis run, is sched-
uled independently of the parent process. Because Linux is a multitasking operatingsystem, both processes appear to execute simultaneously, and you can ’t predict whether
the 
lsprogram will have a chance to run before or after the parent process runs.
In some situations, though, it is desirable for the parent process to wait until one or
more child processes have completed.This can be done with the wait family of system
calls.These functions allow you to wait for a process to finish executing, and enablethe parent process to retrieve information about its child ’s termination.There are four
different system calls in the 
wait family; you can choose to get a little or a lot of infor-
mation about the process that exited, and you can choose whether you care aboutwhich child process terminated.
3.4.2 The waitSystem Calls
The simplest such function is called simply wait. It blocks the calling process until one
of its child processes exits (or an error occurs). It returns a status code via an integerpointer argument, from which you can extract information about how the child processexited. For instance, the 
WEXITSTATUS macro extracts the child process ’s exit code.04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 56
57 3.4 Process Termination
Y ou can use the WIFEXITED macro to determine from a child process ’s exit status
whether that process exited normally (via the exit function or returning from main)
or died from an unhandled signal. In the latter case, use the WTERMSIG macro to extract
from its exit status the signal number by which it died.
Here is the main function from the fork and exec example again.This time, the
parent process calls wait to wait until the child process, in which the lscommand
executes, is finished.
int main (){
int child_status;/* The argument list to pass to the “ls” command.  */char* arg_list[] = {
“ls”,     /* argv[0], the name of the program.  */“-l”, “/”,NULL      /* The argument list must end with a NULL.  */
};/* Spawn a child process running the “ls” command.  Ignore the
returned child process ID.  */
spawn (“ls”, arg_list); /* Wait for the child process to complete.  */wait (&child_status);if (WIFEXITED (child_status))
printf (“the child process exited normally, with exit code %d\n”,
WEXITSTATUS (child_status));
else
printf (“the child process exited abnormally\n”);
return 0;
}
Several similar system calls are available in Linux, which are more flexible or providemore information about the exiting child process.The 
waitpid function can be used
to wait for a specific child process to exit instead of any child process.The wait3 func-
tion returns CPU usage statistics about the exiting child process, and the wait4
function allows you to specify additional options about which processes to wait for.
3.4.3 Zombie Processes
If a child process terminates while its parent is calling a wait function, the child
process vanishes and its termination status is passed to its parent via the wait call. But
what happens when a child process terminates and the parent is not calling wait?
Does it simply vanish? No, because then information about its termination —such as
whether it exited normally and, if so, what its exit status is —would be lost. Instead,
when a child process terminates, is becomes a zombie process.04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 57
58 Chapter 3 Processes
A zombie process is a process that has terminated but has not been cleaned up yet. It
is the responsibility of the parent process to clean up its zombie children.The wait
functions do this, too, so it ’s not necessary to track whether your child process is still
executing before waiting for it. Suppose, for instance, that a program forks a childprocess, performs some other computations, and then calls 
wait. If the child process
has not terminated at that point, the parent process will block in the wait call until the
child process finishes. If the child process finishes before the parent process calls wait,
the child process becomes a zombie.When the parent process calls wait, the zombie
child’s termination status is extracted, the child process is deleted, and the wait call
returns immediately.
What happens if the parent does not clean up its children? They stay around in the
system, as zombie processes.The program in Listing 3.6 forks a child process, whichterminates immediately and then goes to sleep for a minute, without ever cleaning upthe child process.
Listing 3.6 (zombie.c ) Making a Zombie Process
#include <stdlib.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (){
pid_t child_pid;/* Create a child process.  */child_pid = fork ();if (child_pid > 0) {
/* This is the parent process.  Sleep for a minute.  */sleep (60);
}else {
/* This is the child process.  Exit immediately.  */exit (0);
}return 0;
}
Try compiling this file to an executable named make-zombie . Run it, and while it ’s still
running, list the processes on the system by invoking the following command inanother window:
% ps -e -o pid,ppid,stat,cmd04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 58
59 3.4 Process Termination
This lists the process ID, parent process ID, process status, and process command line. Observe that, in addition to the parent 
make-zombie process, there is another
make-zombie process listed. It ’s the child process; note that its parent process ID is 
the process ID of the main make-zombie process.The child process is marked as
<defunct> , and its status code is Z, for zombie.
What happens when the main make-zombie program ends when the parent process
exits, without ever calling wait? Does the zombie process stay around? No —try 
running psagain, and note that both of the make-zombie processes are gone.When a
program exits, its children are inherited by a special process, the init program, which
always runs with process ID of 1 (it ’s the first process started when Linux boots).The
init process automatically cleans up any zombie child processes that it inherits.
3.4.4 Cleaning Up Children Asynchronously
If you ’re using a child process simply to exec another program, it ’s fine to call wait
immediately in the parent process, which will block until the child process completes.But often, you ’ll want the parent process to continue running, as one or more children
execute synchronously. How can you be sure that you clean up child processes thathave completed so that you don ’t leave zombie processes, which consume system
resources, lying around?
One approach would be for the parent process to call 
wait3 or wait4 periodically,
to clean up zombie children. Calling wait for this purpose doesn ’t work well because,
if no children have terminated, the call will block until one does. However, wait3 and
wait4 take an additional flag parameter, to which you can pass the flag value WNOHANG .
With this flag, the function runs in nonblocking mode —it will clean up a terminated
child process if there is one, or simply return if there isn ’t.The return value of the call
is the process ID of the terminated child in the former case, or zero in the latter case.
A more elegant solution is to notify the parent process when a child terminates.
There are several ways to do this using the methods discussed in Chapter 5,“Interprocess Communication, ”but fortunately Linux does this for you, using signals.
When a child process terminates, Linux sends the parent process the 
SIGCHLD signal.
The default disposition of this signal is to do nothing, which is why you might nothave noticed it before.
Thus, an easy way to clean up child processes is by handling 
SIGCHLD . Of course,
when cleaning up the child process, it ’s important to store its termination status if this
information is needed, because once the process is cleaned up using wait, that infor-
mation is no longer available. Listing 3.7 is what it looks like for a program to use a
SIGCHLD handler to clean up its child processes.04 0430 CH03  5/22/01  10:13 AM  Page 59

Note how the signal handler stores the child process ’s exit status in a global variable,
from which the main program can access it. Because the variable is assigned in a signalhandler, its type is

Threads
4
THREADS ,LIKE PROCESSES ,ARE A MECHANISM TO ALLOW A PROGRAM to do more than
one thing at a time.As with processes, threads appear to run concurrently; the Linuxkernel schedules them asynchronously, interrupting each thread from time to time togive others a chance to execute.
Conceptually, a thread exists within a process.Threads are a finer-grained unit of
execution than processes.When you invoke a program, Linux creates a new processand in that process creates a single thread, which runs the program sequentially.Thatthread can create additional threads; all these threads run the same program in thesame process, but each thread may be executing a different part of the program at anygiven time.
We’ve seen how a program can fork a child process.The child process is initially
running its parent ’s program, with its parent ’s virtual memory, file descriptors, and so
on copied.The child process can modify its memory, close file descriptors, and the likewithout affecting its parent, and vice versa.When a program creates another thread,though, nothing is copied.The creating and the created thread share the same memoryspace, file descriptors, and other system resources as the original. If one thread changesthe value of a variable, for instance, the other thread subsequently will see the modi-fied value. Similarly, if one thread closes a file descriptor, other threads may not read05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 61
62 Chapter 4 Threads
from or write to that file descriptor. Because a process and all its threads can be exe-cuting only one program at a time, if any thread inside a process calls one of the 
exec
functions, all the other threads are ended (the new program may, of course, create newthreads).
GNU/Linux implements the POSIX standard thread API (known as pthreads ).All
thread functions and data types are declared in the header file 
<pthread.h> .The
pthread functions are not included in the standard C library. Instead, they are in
libpthread , so you should add -lpthread to the command line when you link your
program.
4.1 Thread Creation
Each thread in a process is identified by a thread ID .When referring to thread IDs in
C or C++ programs, use the type pthread_t .
Upon creation, each thread executes a thread function .This is just an ordinary func-
tion and contains the code that the thread should run.When the function returns, thethread exits. On GNU/Linux, thread functions take a single parameter, of type 
void* ,
and have a void* return type.The parameter is the thread argument : GNU/Linux passes
the value along to the thread without looking at it.Y our program can use this parame-ter to pass data to a new thread. Similarly, your program can use the return value topass data from an exiting thread back to its creator.
The 
pthread_create function creates a new thread.Y ou provide it with the following:
1. A pointer to a pthread_t variable, in which the thread ID of the new thread is
stored.
2. A pointer to a thread attribute object.This object controls details of how the
thread interacts with the rest of the program. If you pass NULL as the thread
attribute, a thread will be created with the default thread attributes.Threadattributes are discussed in Section 4.1.5, “Thread Attributes. ”
3. A pointer to the thread function.This is an ordinary function pointer, of this
type:
void* (*) (void*)
4. A thread argument value of type void* . Whatever you pass is simply passed as
the argument to the thread function when the thread begins executing.
A call to pthread_create returns immediately, and the original thread continues exe-
cuting the instructions following the call. Meanwhile, the new thread begins executingthe thread function. Linux schedules both threads asynchronously, and your programmust not rely on the relative order in which instructions are executed in the twothreads.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 62
63 4.1 Thread Creation
The program in Listing 4.1 creates a thread that prints x ’s continuously to standard
error.After calling pthread_create , the main thread prints o ’s continuously to standard
error.
Listing 4.1 (thread-create.c ) Create a Thread
#include <pthread.h>#include <stdio.h>/* Prints x’s to stderr.  The parameter is unused.  Does not return.  */void* print_xs (void* unused){
while (1) 
fputc (‘x’, stderr);
return NULL;
}/* The main program.  */int main (){
pthread_t thread_id;/* Create a new thread.  The new thread will run the print_xs
function.  */
pthread_create (&thread_id, NULL, &print_xs, NULL);/* Print o’s continuously to stderr.  */while (1) 
fputc (‘o’, stderr);
return 0;
}
Compile and link this program using the following code:
% cc -o thread-create thread-create.c -lpthread
Try running it to see what happens. Notice the unpredictable pattern of x ’s and o ’s as
Linux alternately schedules the two threads.
Under normal circumstances, a thread exits in one of two ways. One way, as illus-
trated previously, is by returning from the thread function.The return value from thethread function is taken to be the return value of the thread.Alternately, a thread canexit explicitly by calling 
pthread_exit .This function may be called from within the
thread function or from some other function called directly or indirectly by the threadfunction.The argument to 
pthread_exit is the thread ’s return value.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 63
64 Chapter 4 Threads
4.1.1 Passing Data to Threads
The thread argument provides a convenient method of passing data to threads.Because the type of the argument is 
void* , though, you can ’t pass a lot of data directly
via the argument. Instead, use the thread argument to pass a pointer to some structureor array of data. One commonly used technique is to define a structure for eachthread function, which contains the “parameters ”that the thread function expects.
Using the thread argument, it ’s easy to reuse the same thread function for many
threads.All these threads execute the same code, but on different data.
The program in Listing 4.2 is similar to the previous example.This one creates two
new threads, one to print x ’s and the other to print o ’s. Instead of printing infinitely,
though, each thread prints a fixed number of characters and then exits by returningfrom the thread function.The same thread function,
char_print , is used by both
threads, but each is configured differently using struct char_print_parms .
Listing 4.2 (thread-create2 ) Create Two Threads
#include <pthread.h>#include <stdio.h>/* Parameters to print_function.  */struct char_print_parms{
/* The character to print.  */char character;/* The number of times to print it.  */int count;
};/* Prints a number of characters to stderr, as given by PARAMETERS,
which is a pointer to a struct char_print_parms.  */
void* char_print (void* parameters){
/* Cast the cookie pointer to the right type.  */struct char_print_parms* p = (struct char_print_parms*) parameters;int i;for (i = 0; i < p->count; ++i)
fputc (p->character, stderr);
return NULL;
}/* The main program.  */int main (){
pthread_t thread1_id;05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 64
65 4.1 Thread Creation
pthread_t thread2_id;struct char_print_parms thread1_args;struct char_print_parms thread2_args;/* Create a new thread to print 30,000 ’x’s.  */thread1_args.character = ’x’;thread1_args.count = 30000;pthread_create (&thread1_id, NULL, &char_print, &thread1_args);/* Create a new thread to print 20,000 o’s.  */thread2_args.character = ’o’;thread2_args.count = 20000;pthread_create (&thread2_id, NULL, &char_print, &thread2_args);return 0;
}
But wait! The program in Listing 4.2 has a serious bug in it.The main thread (which
runs the main function) creates the thread parameter structures ( thread1_args and
thread2_args ) as local variables, and then passes pointers to these structures to the
threads it creates.What ’s to prevent Linux from scheduling the three threads in such a
way that main finishes executing before either of the other two threads are done?
Nothing! But if this happens, the memory containing the thread parameter structures
will be deallocated while the other two threads are still accessing it.
4.1.2 Joining Threads
One solution is to force main to wait until the other two threads are done.What we
need is a function similar to wait that waits for a thread to finish instead of a process.
That function is pthread_join, which takes two arguments: the thread ID of the
thread to wait for, and a pointer to a void* variable that will receive the finished
thread ’s return value. If you don ’t care about the thread return value, pass NULL as the
second argument.
Listing 4.3 shows the corrected main function for the buggy example in Listing 4.2.
In this version, main does not exit until both of the threads printing x ’s and o ’s have
completed, so they are no longer using the argument structures.
Listing 4.3 Revised Main Function for thread-create2.c
int main (){
pthread_t thread1_id;pthread_t thread2_id;struct char_print_parms thread1_args;struct char_print_parms thread2_args;

}
The moral of the story: Make sure that any data you pass to a thread by reference isnot deallocated, even by a different thread , until you ’re sure that the thread is done with
it.This is true both for local variables, which are deallocated when they go out ofscope, and for heap-allocated variables, which you deallocate by calling 
free (or using
delete in C++).
4.1.3 Thread Return Values
If the second argument you pass to pthread_join is non-null, the thread ’s return value
will be placed in the location pointed to by that argument.The thread return value,like the thread argument, is of type 
void* . If you want to pass back a single intor
other small number, you can do this easily by casting the value to void* and then 
casting back to the appropriate type after calling pthread_join .1
The program in Listing 4.4 computes the nth prime number in a separate thread.
That thread returns the desired prime number as its thread return value.The mainthread, meanwhile, is free to execute other code. Note that the successive divisionalgorithm used in 
compute_prime is quite inefficient; consult a book on numerical
algorithims if you need to compute many prime numbers in your programs.Listing 4.3 Continued
1. Note that this is not portable, and it ’s up to you to make sure that your value can be cast
safely to void* and back without losing bits.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 66

68 Chapter 4 Threads
4.1.4 More on Thread IDs
Occasionally, it is useful for a sequence of code to determine which thread is execut-ing it.The 
pthread_self function returns the thread ID of the thread in which it is
called.This thread ID may be compared with another thread ID using the
pthread_equal function.
These functions can be useful for determining whether a particular thread ID 
corresponds to the current thread. For instance, it is an error for a thread to call
pthread_join to join itself. (In this case, pthread_join would return the error code
EDEADLK .) T o check for this beforehand, you might use code like this:
if (!pthread_equal (pthread_self (), other_thread))
pthread_join (other_thread, NULL);
4.1.5 Thread Attributes
Thread attributes provide a mechanism for fine-tuning the behavior of individualthreads. Recall that 
pthread_create accepts an argument that is a pointer to a thread
attribute object. If you pass a null pointer, the default thread attributes are used toconfigure the new thread. However, you may create and customize a thread attributeobject to specify other values for the attributes.
T o specify customized thread attributes, you must follow these steps:
1. Create a 
pthread_attr_t object.The easiest way is simply to declare an auto-
matic variable of this type.
2. Call pthread_attr_init , passing a pointer to this object.This initializes the
attributes to their default values.
3. Modify the attribute object to contain the desired attribute values.4. Pass a pointer to the attribute object when calling 
pthread_create .
5. Call pthread_attr_destroy to release the attribute object.The pthread_attr_t
variable itself is not deallocated; it may be reinitialized with pthread_attr_init .
A single thread attribute object may be used to start several threads. It is not necessaryto keep the thread attribute object around after the threads have been created.
For most GNU/Linux application programming tasks, only one thread attribute is
typically of interest (the other available attributes are primarily for specialty real-timeprogramming).This attribute is the thread ’s detach state .A thread may be created as a
joinable thread (the default) or as a detached thread .A joinable thread, like a process, is not
automatically cleaned up by GNU/Linux when it terminates. Instead, the thread ’s exit
state hangs around in the system (kind of like a zombie process) until another threadcalls 
pthread_join to obtain its return value. Only then are its resources released.A
detached thread, in contrast, is cleaned up automatically when it terminates. Because adetached thread is immediately cleaned up, another thread may not synchronize on itscompletion by using 
pthread_join or obtain its return value.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 68
69 4.2 Thread Cancellation
T o set the detach state in a thread attribute object, use pthread_attr_setdetachstate .
The first argument is a pointer to the thread attribute object, and the second is thedesired detach state. Because the joinable state is the default, it is necessary to call this onlyto create detached threads; pass 
PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED as the second argument.
The code in Listing 4.5 creates a detached thread by setting the detach state thread
attribute for the thread.
Listing 4.5 (detached.c ) Skeleton Program That Creates a Detached Thread
#include <pthread.h>void* thread_function (void* thread_arg){
/* Do work here...  */
}int main (){
pthread_attr_t attr;pthread_t thread;pthread_attr_init (&attr);pthread_attr_setdetachstate (&attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED);pthread_create (&thread, &attr, &thread_function, NULL);pthread_attr_destroy (&attr);/* Do work here...  *//* No need to join the second thread.  */return 0;
}
Even if a thread is created in a joinable state, it may later be turned into a detachedthread.T o do this, call 
pthread_detach . Once a thread is detached, it cannot be made
joinable again.
4.2 Thread Cancellation
Under normal circumstances, a thread terminates when it exits normally, either byreturning from its thread function or by calling 
pthread_exit . However, it is possible
for a thread to request that another thread terminate.This is called canceling a thread.
T o cancel a thread, call pthread_cancel , passing the thread ID of the thread to be
canceled.A canceled thread may later be joined; in fact, you should join a canceledthread to free up its resources, unless the thread is detached (see Section 4.1.5, “Thread
Attributes ”).The return value of a canceled thread is the special value given by
PTHREAD_CANCELED .05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 69
70 Chapter 4 Threads
Often a thread may be in some code that must be executed in an all-or-nothing
fashion. For instance, the thread may allocate some resources, use them, and then deal-locate them. If the thread is canceled in the middle of this code, it may not have theopportunity to deallocate the resources, and thus the resources will be leaked.T ocounter this possibility, it is possible for a thread to control whether and when it canbe canceled.
A thread may be in one of three states with regard to thread cancellation.
nThe thread may be asynchronously cancelable .The thread may be canceled at any
point in its execution.
nThe thread may be synchronously cancelable .The thread may be canceled, but not
at just any point in its execution. Instead, cancellation requests are queued, andthe thread is canceled only when it reaches specific points in its execution.
nA thread may be uncancelable .Attempts to cancel the thread are quietly ignored.
When initially created, a thread is synchronously cancelable.
4.2.1 Synchronous and Asynchronous Threads
An asynchronously cancelable thread may be canceled at any point in its execution.Asynchronously cancelable thread, in contrast, may be canceled only at particular placesin its execution.These places are called cancellation points .The thread will queue a can-
cellation request until it reaches the next cancellation point.
T o make a thread asynchronously cancelable, use 
pthread_setcanceltype .This
affects the thread that actually calls the function.The first argument should be
PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS to make the thread asynchronously cancelable, or
PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED to return it to the synchronously cancelable state.The sec-
ond argument, if not null, is a pointer to a variable that will receive the previous can-cellation type for the thread.This call, for example, makes the calling threadasynchronously cancelable.
pthread_setcanceltype (PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS, NULL);
What constitutes a cancellation point, and where should these be placed? The mostdirect way to create a cancellation point is to call 
pthread_testcancel .This does
nothing except process a pending cancellation in a synchronously cancelable thread.Y ou should call 
pthread_testcancel periodically during lengthy computations in a
thread function, at points where the thread can be canceled without leaking anyresources or producing other ill effects.
Certain other functions are implicitly cancellation points as well.These are listed on
the 
pthread_cancel man page. Note that other functions may use these functions
internally and thus will indirectly be cancellation points.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 70
71 4.2 Thread Cancellation
4.2.2 Uncancelable Critical Sections
A thread may disable cancellation of itself altogether with the 
pthread_setcancelstate function. Like pthread_setcanceltype , this affects the calling 
thread.The first argument is PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE to disable cancellation, or
PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE to re-enable cancellation.The second argument, if not null,
points to a variable that will receive the previous cancellation state.This call, forinstance, disables thread cancellation in the calling thread.
pthread_setcancelstate (PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, NULL);
Using pthread_setcancelstate enables you to implement critical sections .A critical sec-
tion is a sequence of code that must be executed either in its entirety or not at all; inother words, if a thread begins executing the critical section, it must continue until theend of the critical section without being canceled.
For example, suppose that you ’re writing a routine for a banking program that
transfers money from one account to another.T o do this, you must add value to thebalance in one account and deduct the same value from the balance of anotheraccount. If the thread running your routine happened to be canceled at just the wrongtime between these two operations, the program would have spuriously increased thebank’s total deposits by failing to complete the transaction.T o prevent this possibility,
place the two operations in a critical section.
Y ou might implement the transfer with a function such as 
process_transaction ,
shown in Listing 4.6.This function disables thread cancellation to start a critical sec-tion before it modifies either account balance.
Listing 4.6 (critical-section.c ) Protect a Bank Transaction with a Critical Section
#include <pthread.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>/* An array of balances in accounts, indexed by account number.  */float* account_balances;/* Transfer DOLLARS from account FROM_ACCT to account TO_ACCT.  Return
0 if the transaction succeeded, or 1 if the balance FROM_ACCT istoo small.  */
int process_transaction (int from_acct, int to_acct, float dollars){
int old_cancel_state;/* Check the balance in FROM_ACCT.  */if (account_balances[from_acct] < dollars)
return 1;
continues05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 71
72 Chapter 4 Threads
/* Begin critical section.  */pthread_setcancelstate (PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, &old_cancel_state);/* Move the money.  */account_balances[to_acct] += dollars;account_balances[from_acct] -= dollars;/* End critical section.  */pthread_setcancelstate (old_cancel_state, NULL);return 0;
}
Note that it ’s important to restore the old cancel state at the end of the critical section
rather than setting it unconditionally to PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE .This enables you to
call the process_transaction function safely from within another critical section —in
that case, your function will leave the cancel state the same way it found it.
4.2.3 When to Use Thread Cancellation
In general, it ’s a good idea not to use thread cancellation to end the execution of a
thread, except in unusual circumstances. During normal operation, a better strategy isto indicate to the thread that it should exit, and then to wait for the thread to exit onits own in an orderly fashion.We ’ll discuss techniques for communicating with the
thread later in this chapter, and in Chapter 5, “Interprocess Communication. ”
4.3 Thread-Specific Data
Unlike processes, all threads in a single program share the same address space.Thismeans that if one thread modifies a location in memory (for instance, a global vari-able), the change is visible to all other threads.This allows multiple threads to operateon the same data without the use interprocess communication mechanisms (which aredescribed in Chapter 5).
Each thread has its own call stack, however.This allows each thread to execute dif-
ferent code and to call and return from subroutines in the usual way.As in a single-threaded program, each invocation of a subroutine in each thread has its own set oflocal variables, which are stored on the stack for that thread.
Sometimes, however, it is desirable to duplicate a certain variable so that each
thread has a separate copy. GNU/Linux supports this by providing each thread with athread-specific data area.The variables stored in this area are duplicated for each thread,
and each thread may modify its copy of a variable without affecting other threads.Because all threads share the same memory space, thread-specific data may not beaccessed using normal variable references. GNU/Linux provides special functions forsetting and retrieving values from the thread-specific data area.Listing 4.6 Continued05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 72
73 4.3 Thread-Specific Data
Y ou may create as many thread-specific data items as you want, each of type void* .
Each item is referenced by a key.T o create a new key, and thus a new data item foreach thread, use 
pthread_key_create .The first argument is a pointer to a
pthread_key_t variable.That key value can be used by each thread to access its own
copy of the corresponding data item.The second argument to pthread_key_t is a
cleanup function. If you pass a function pointer here, GNU/Linux automatically callsthat function when each thread exits, passing the thread-specific value correspondingto that key.This is particularly handy because the cleanup function is called even if thethread is canceled at some arbitrary point in its execution. If the thread-specific valueis null, the thread cleanup function is not called. If you don ’t need a cleanup function,
you may pass null instead of a function pointer.
After you ’ve created a key, each thread can set its thread-specific value correspond-
ing to that key by calling 
pthread_setspecific .The first argument is the key, and the
second is the void* thread-specific value to store.T o retrieve a thread-specific data
item, call pthread_getspecific , passing the key as its argument.
Suppose, for instance, that your application divides a task among multiple threads.
For audit purposes, each thread is to have a separate log file, in which progress mes-sages for that thread ’s tasks are recorded.The thread-specific data area is a convenient
place to store the file pointer for the log file for each individual thread.
Listing 4.7 shows how you might implement this.The 
main function in this sample
program creates a key to store the thread-specific file pointer and then stores it in
thread_log_key . Because this is a global variable, it is shared by all threads.When each
thread starts executing its thread function, it opens a log file and stores the file pointerunder that key. Later, any of these threads may call 
write_to_thread_log to write a
message to the thread-specific log file.That function retrieves the file pointer for thethread ’s log file from thread-specific data and writes the message.
Listing 4.7 (tsd.c) Per-Thread Log Files Implemented with Thread-Specific Data

pthread_create (&(threads[i]), NULL, thread_function, NULL);
/* Wait for all threads to finish.  */for (i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
pthread_join (threads[i], NULL);
return 0;
}
Observe that thread_function does not need to close the log file.That ’s because when
the log file key was created, close_thread_log was specified as the cleanup function
for that key.Whenever a thread exits, GNU/Linux calls that function, passing thethread-specific value for the thread log key.This function takes care of closing thelog file.Listing 4.7 Continued05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 74
75 4.3 Thread-specific Data
4.3.1 Cleanup Handlers
The cleanup functions for thread-specific data keys can be very handy for ensuringthat resources are not leaked when a thread exits or is canceled. Sometimes, though,it’s useful to be able to specify cleanup functions without creating a new thread-
specific data item that ’s duplicated for each thread. GNU/Linux provides cleanup
handlers for this purpose.
A cleanup handler is simply a function that should be called when a thread exits.
The handler takes a single 
void* parameter, and its argument value is provided when
the handler is registered —this makes it easy to use the same handler function to deal-
locate multiple resource instances.
A cleanup handler is a temporary measure, used to deallocate a resource only if the
thread exits or is canceled instead of finishing execution of a particular region of code.Under normal circumstances, when the thread does not exit and is not canceled, theresource should be deallocated explicitly and the cleanup handler should be removed.
T o register a cleanup handler, call 
pthread_cleanup_push , passing a pointer 
to the cleanup function and the value of its void* argument.The call to
pthread_cleanup_push must be balanced by a corresponding call to
pthread_cleanup_pop , which unregisters the cleanup handler.As a convenience,
pthread_cleanup_pop takes an intflag argument; if the flag is nonzero, the cleanup
action is actually performed as it is unregistered.
The program fragment in Listing 4.8 shows how you might use a cleanup handler
to make sure that a dynamically allocated buffer is cleaned up if the thread terminates.
Listing 4.8 (cleanup.c ) Program Fragment Demonstrating a Thread 
Cleanup Handler
#include <malloc.h>#include <pthread.h>/* Allocate a temporary buffer.  */void* allocate_buffer (size_t size){
return malloc (size);
}/* Deallocate a temporary buffer.  */void deallocate_buffer (void* buffer){
free (buffer);
}void do_some_work (){
/* Allocate a temporary buffer.  */

76 Chapter 4 Threads
void* temp_buffer = allocate_buffer (1024);/* Register a cleanup handler for this buffer, to deallocate it in
case the thread exits or is cancelled.  */
pthread_cleanup_push (deallocate_buffer, temp_buffer);/* Do some work here that might call pthread_exit or might be
cancelled...  */
/* Unregister the cleanup handler.  Because we pass a nonzero value,
this actually performs the cleanup by callingdeallocate_buffer.  */
pthread_cleanup_pop (1);
}
Because the argument to pthread_cleanup_pop is nonzero in this case, the cleanup
function deallocate_buffer is called automatically here and does not need to be
called explicitly. In this simple case, we could have used the standard library function
free directly as our cleanup handler function instead of deallocate_buffer .
4.3.2 Thread Cleanup in C++
C++ programmers are accustomed to getting cleanup “for free ”by wrapping cleanup
actions in object destructors.When the objects go out of scope, either because a blockis executed to completion or because an exception is thrown, C++ makes sure thatdestructors are called for those automatic variables that have them.This provides ahandy mechanism to make sure that cleanup code is called no matter how the block isexited.
If a thread calls 
pthread_exit , though, C++ doesn ’t guarantee that destructors are
called for all automatic variables on the thread ’s stack.A clever way to recover this
functionality is to invoke pthread_exit at the top level of the thread function by
throwing a special exception.
The program in Listing 4.9 demonstrates this. Using this technique, a function indi-
cates its intention to exit the thread by throwing a ThreadExitException instead of
calling pthread_exit directly. Because the exception is caught in the top-level thread
function, all local variables on the thread ’s stack will be destroyed properly as the
exception percolates up.

4.4 Synchronization and Critical Sections
Programming with threads is very tricky because most threaded programs are concur-rent programs. In particular, there ’s no way to know when the system will schedule
one thread to run and when it will run another. One thread might run for a very long time, or the system might switch among threads very quickly. On a system withmultiple processors, the system might even schedule multiple threads to run at literallythe same time.
Debugging a threaded program is difficult because you cannot always easily repro-
duce the behavior that caused the problem.Y ou might run the program once and haveeverything work fine; the next time you run it, it might crash.There ’s no way to make
the system schedule the threads exactly the same way it did before.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 77
78 Chapter 4 Threads
The ultimate cause of most bugs involving threads is that the threads are accessing
the same data.As mentioned previously, that ’s one of the powerful aspects of threads,
but it can also be dangerous. If one thread is only partway through updating a datastructure when another thread accesses the same data structure, chaos is likely toensue. Often, buggy threaded programs contain a code that will work only if onethread gets scheduled more often —or sooner —than another thread.These bugs are
called race conditions ; the threads are racing one another to change the same data 
structure.
4.4.1 Race Conditions
Suppose that your program has a series of queued jobs that are processed by severalconcurrent threads.The queue of jobs is represented by a linked list of 
struct job
objects.
After each thread finishes an operation, it checks the queue to see if an additional
job is available. If job_queue is non-null, the thread removes the head of the linked list
and sets job_queue to the next job on the list.
The thread function that processes jobs in the queue might look like Listing 4.10.
Listing 4.10 (job-queue1.c ) Thread Function to Process Jobs from the Queue
#include <malloc.h>struct job {
/* Link field for linked list.  */struct job* next; /* Other fields describing work to be done... */
};/* A linked list of pending jobs.  */struct job* job_queue;/* Process queued jobs until the queue is empty.  */void* thread_function (void* arg){
while (job_queue != NULL) {
/* Get the next available job.  */struct job* next_job = job_queue;/* Remove this job from the list.  */job_queue = job_queue->next;/* Carry out the work.  */process_job (next_job);/* Clean up.  */free (next_job);
}return NULL;
}05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 78
79 4.4 Synchronization and Critical Sections
Now suppose that two threads happen to finish a job at about the same time, but onlyone job remains in the queue.The first thread checks whether 
job_queue is null; find-
ing that it isn ’t, the thread enters the loop and stores the pointer to the job object in
next_job .At this point, Linux happens to interrupt the first thread and schedules the
second.The second thread also checks job_queue and finding it non-null, also assigns
the same job pointer to next_job . By unfortunate coincidence, we now have two
threads executing the same job.
T o make matters worse, one thread will unlink the job object from the queue,
leaving job_queue containing null.When the other thread evaluates job_queue->next ,
a segmentation fault will result.
This is an example of a race condition. Under “lucky ”circumstances, this particular
schedule of the two threads may never occur, and the race condition may neverexhibit itself. Only under different circumstances, perhaps when running on a heavilyloaded system (or on an important customer ’s new multiprocessor server!) may the
bug exhibit itself.
T o eliminate race conditions, you need a way to make operations atomic .An atomic
operation is indivisible and uninterruptible; once the operation starts, it will not bepaused or interrupted until it completes, and no other operation will take place mean-while. In this particular example, you want to check 
job_queue ; if it’s not empty,
remove the first job, all as a single atomic operation.
4.4.2 Mutexes
The solution to the job queue race condition problem is to let only one thread accessthe queue of jobs at a time. Once a thread starts looking at the queue, no other threadshould be able to access it until the first thread has decided whether to process a joband, if so, has removed the job from the list.
Implementing this requires support from the operating system. GNU/Linux pro-
vides mutexes , short for MUTual EXclusion locks .A mutex is a special lock that only one
thread may lock at a time. If a thread locks a mutex and then a second thread also triesto lock the same mutex, the second thread is blocked , or put on hold. Only when the
first thread unlocks the mutex is the second thread unblocked —allowed to resume 
execution. GNU/Linux guarantees that race conditions do not occur among threadsattempting to lock a mutex; only one thread will ever get the lock, and all otherthreads will be blocked.
Think of a mutex as the lock on a lavatory door.Whoever gets there first enters the
lavatory and locks the door. If someone else attempts to enter the lavatory while it ’s
occupied, that person will find the door locked and will be forced to wait outsideuntil the occupant emerges.
T o create a mutex, create a variable of type 
pthread_mutex_t and pass a pointer to
it to pthread_mutex_init .The second argument to pthread_mutex_init is a pointer 
to a mutex attribute object, which specifies attributes of the mutex.As with05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 79
80 Chapter 4 Threads
pthread_create , if the attribute pointer is null, default attributes are assumed.The
mutex variable should be initialized only once.This code fragment demonstrates thedeclaration and initialization of a mutex variable.
pthread_mutex_t mutex;pthread_mutex_init (&mutex, NULL);
Another simpler way to create a mutex with default attributes is to initialize it with the special value 
PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER . No additional call to
pthread_mutex_init is necessary.This is particularly convenient for global variables
(and, in C++, static data members).The previous code fragment could equivalentlyhave been written like this:
pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
A thread may attempt to lock a mutex by calling pthread_mutex_lock on it. If the
mutex was unlocked, it becomes locked and the function returns immediately. If themutex was locked by another thread,
pthread_mutex_lock blocks execution and
returns only eventually when the mutex is unlocked by the other thread. More thanone thread may be blocked on a locked mutex at one time.When the mutex isunlocked, only one of the blocked threads (chosen unpredictably) is unblocked andallowed to lock the mutex; the other threads stay blocked.
A call to 
pthread_mutex_unlock unlocks a mutex.This function should always be
called from the same thread that locked the mutex.
Listing 4.11 shows another version of the job queue example. Now the queue is
protected by a mutex. Before accessing the queue (either for read or write), eachthread locks a mutex first. Only when the entire sequence of checking the queue andremoving a job is complete is the mutex unlocked.This prevents the race conditionpreviously described.
Listing 4.11 (job-queue2.c ) Job Queue Thread Function, Protected by a Mutex
#include <malloc.h>#include <pthread.h>struct job {
/* Link field for linked list.  */struct job* next; /* Other fields describing work to be done... */
};/* A linked list of pending jobs.  */struct job* job_queue;/* A mutex protecting job_queue.  */pthread_mutex_t job_queue_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 80
81 4.4 Synchronization and Critical Sections
/* Process queued jobs until the queue is empty.  */void* thread_function (void* arg){
while (1) {
struct job* next_job;/* Lock the mutex on the job queue.  */pthread_mutex_lock (&job_queue_mutex);/* Now it’s safe to check if the queue is empty.  */if (job_queue == NULL)
next_job = NULL;
else {
/* Get the next available job.  */next_job = job_queue;/* Remove this job from the list.  */job_queue = job_queue->next;
}/* Unlock the mutex on the job queue because we’re done with the
queue for now.  */
pthread_mutex_unlock (&job_queue_mutex);/* Was the queue empty?  If so, end the thread.  */if (next_job == NULL)
break;
/* Carry out the work.  */process_job (next_job);/* Clean up.  */free (next_job);
}return NULL;
}
All accesses to job_queue , the shared data pointer, come between the call to
pthread_mutex_lock and the call to pthread_mutex_unlock .A job object, stored in
next_job , is accessed outside this region only after that object has been removed from
the queue and is therefore inaccessible to other threads.
Note that if the queue is empty (that is, job_queue is null), we don ’t break out of
the loop immediately because this would leave the mutex permanently locked andwould prevent any other thread from accessing the job queue ever again. Instead, weremember this fact by setting 
next_job to null and breaking out only after unlocking
the mutex.
Use of the mutex to lock job_queue is not automatic; it ’s up to you to add code to
lock the mutex before accessing that variable and then to unlock it afterward. Forexample, a function to add a job to the job queue might look like this:
void enqueue_job (struct job* new_job){
pthread_mutex_lock (&job_queue_mutex);05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 81
82 Chapter 4 Threads
new_job->next = job_queue;job_queue = new_job;pthread_mutex_unlock (&job_queue_mutex);
}
4.4.3 Mutex Deadlocks
Mutexes provide a mechanism for allowing one thread to block the execution ofanother.This opens up the possibility of a new class of bugs, called deadlocks .A dead-
lock occurs when one or more threads are stuck waiting for something that never willoccur.
A simple type of deadlock may occur when the same thread attempts to lock a
mutex twice in a row.The behavior in this case depends on what kind of mutex isbeing used.Three kinds of mutexes exist:
nLocking a fast mutex (the default kind) will cause a deadlock to occur.An
attempt to lock the mutex blocks until the mutex is unlocked. But because thethread that locked the mutex is blocked on the same mutex, the lock cannotever be released.
nLocking a recursive mutex does not cause a deadlock.A recursive mutex may
safely be locked many times by the same thread.The mutex remembers howmany times 
pthread_mutex_lock was called on it by the thread that holds the
lock; that thread must make the same number of calls to pthread_mutex_unlock
before the mutex is actually unlocked and another thread is allowed to lock it.
nGNU/Linux will detect and flag a double lock on an error-checking mutex that
would otherwise cause a deadlock.The second consecutive call to
pthread_mutex_lock returns the failure code EDEADLK .
By default, a GNU/Linux mutex is of the fast kind.T o create a mutex of one of the other two kinds, first create a mutex attribute object by declaring a
pthread_mutexattr_t variable and calling pthread_mutexattr_init on a 
pointer to it.Then set the mutex kind by calling pthread_mutexattr_setkind_np ; the
first argument is a pointer to the mutex attribute object, and the second is
PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE_NP for a recursive mutex, or PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK_NP
for an error-checking mutex. Pass a pointer to this attribute object to
pthread_mutex_init to create a mutex of this kind, and then destroy the attribute
object with pthread_mutexattr_destroy .
This code sequence illustrates creation of an error-checking mutex, for instance:
pthread_mutexattr_t attr;pthread_mutex_t mutex;pthread_mutexattr_init (&attr);pthread_mutexattr_setkind_np (&attr, PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK_NP);pthread_mutex_init (&mutex, &attr);pthread_mutexattr_destroy (&attr);05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 82
83 4.4 Synchronization and Critical Sections
As suggested by the “np”suffix, the recursive and error-checking mutex kinds are spe-
cific to GNU/Linux and are not portable.Therefore, it is generally not advised to usethem in programs. (Error-checking mutexes can be useful when debugging, though.) 
4.4.4 Nonblocking Mutex Tests
Occasionally, it is useful to test whether a mutex is locked without actually blockingon it. For instance, a thread may need to lock a mutex but may have other work to doinstead of blocking if the mutex is already locked. Because 
pthread_mutex_lock will
not return until the mutex becomes unlocked, some other function is necessary.
GNU/Linux provides pthread_mutex_trylock for this purpose. If you call
pthread_mutex_trylock on an unlocked mutex, you will lock the mutex as if you had
called pthread_mutex_lock , and pthread_mutex_trylock will return zero. However, if
the mutex is already locked by another thread, pthread_mutex_trylock will not block.
Instead, it will return immediately with the error code EBUSY .The mutex lock held by
the other thread is not affected.Y ou may try again later to lock the mutex.
4.4.5 Semaphores for Threads
In the preceding example, in which several threads process jobs from a queue, themain thread function of the threads carries out the next job until no jobs are left andthen exits the thread.This scheme works if all the jobs are queued in advance or ifnew jobs are queued at least as quickly as the threads process them. However, if thethreads work too quickly, the queue of jobs will empty and the threads will exit. Ifnew jobs are later enqueued, no threads may remain to process them.What we mightlike instead is a mechanism for blocking the threads when the queue empties untilnew jobs become available.
A semaphore provides a convenient method for doing this.A semaphore is a counter
that can be used to synchronize multiple threads.As with a mutex, GNU/Linux guar-antees that checking or modifying the value of a semaphore can be done safely, with-out creating a race condition.
Each semaphore has a counter value, which is a non-negative integer.A semaphore
supports two basic operations:
nA waitoperation decrements the value of the semaphore by 1. If the value is
already zero, the operation blocks until the value of the semaphore becomespositive (due to the action of some other thread).When the semaphore ’s value
becomes positive, it is decremented by 1 and the wait operation returns.
nA postoperation increments the value of the semaphore by 1. If the semaphore
was previously zero and other threads are blocked in a wait operation on thatsemaphore, one of those threads is unblocked and its wait operation completes(which brings the semaphore ’s value back to zero).05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 83
84 Chapter 4 Threads
Note that GNU/Linux provides two slightly different semaphore implementations.The one we describe here is the POSIX standard semaphore implementation. Usethese semaphores when communicating among threads The other implementation,used for communication among processes, is described in Section 5.2, “Process
Semaphores. ”If you use semaphores, include 
<semaphore.h> .
A semaphore is represented by a sem_t variable. Before using it, you must initialize
it using the sem_init function, passing a pointer to the sem_t variable.The second
parameter should be zero,2and the third parameter is the semaphore ’s initial value. If
you no longer need a semaphore, it ’s good to deallocate it with sem_destroy .
T o wait on a semaphore, use sem_wait .T o post to a semaphore, use sem_post .
A nonblocking wait function, sem_trywait , is also provided. It ’s similar to
pthread_mutex_trylock —if the wait would have blocked because the semaphore ’s
value was zero, the function returns immediately, with error value EAGAIN , instead of
blocking.
GNU/Linux also provides a function to retrieve the current value of a semaphore,
sem_getvalue , which places the value in the intvariable pointed to by its second
argument.Y ou should not use the semaphore value you get from this function to makea decision whether to post to or wait on the semaphore, though.T o do this could leadto a race condition:Another thread could change the semaphore ’s value between the
call to 
sem_getvalue and the call to another semaphore function. Use the atomic post
and wait functions instead.
Returning to our job queue example, we can use a semaphore to count the num-
ber of jobs waiting in the queue. Listing 4.12 controls the queue with a semaphore.The function 
enqueue_job adds a new job to the queue.
Listing 4.12 (job-queue3.c ) Job Queue Controlled by a Semaphore
#include <malloc.h>#include <pthread.h>#include <semaphore.h>struct job {
/* Link field for linked list.  */struct job* next; /* Other fields describing work to be done... */
};/* A linked list of pending jobs.  */struct job* job_queue;/* A mutex protecting job_queue.  */pthread_mutex_t job_queue_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
2.A nonzero value would indicate a semaphore that can be shared across processes, which is
not supported by GNU/Linux for this type of semaphore.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 84

If
threads are blocked, waiting on the semaphore, one will becomeunblocked so it can process the job.  */
sem_post (&job_queue_count);/* Unlock the job queue mutex.  */pthread_mutex_unlock (&job_queue_mutex);
}
Before taking a job from the front of the queue, each thread will first wait on thesemaphore. If the semaphore ’s value is zero, indicating that the queue is empty, the
thread will simply block until the semaphore ’s value becomes positive, indicating that a
job has been added to the queue.
The 
enqueue_job function adds a job to the queue. Just like thread_function ,i t
needs to lock the queue mutex before modifying the queue.After adding a job to thequeue, it posts to the semaphore, indicating that a new job is available. In the versionshown in Listing 4.12, the threads that process the jobs never exit; if no jobs are avail-able for a while, all the threads simply block in 
sem_wait .
4.4.6 Condition Variables
We’ve shown how to use a mutex to protect a variable against simultaneous access by
two threads and how to use semaphores to implement a shared counter.A condition
variable is a third synchronization device that GNU/Linux provides; with it, you can
implement more complex conditions under which threads execute.
Suppose that you write a thread function that executes a loop infinitely, performing
some work on each iteration.The thread loop, however, needs to be controlled by aflag:The loop runs only when the flag is set; when the flag is not set, the loop pauses.
Listing 4.13 shows how you might implement this by spinning in a loop. During
each iteration of the loop, the thread function checks that the flag is set. Because theflag is accessed by multiple threads, it is protected by a mutex.This implementationmay be correct, but it is not efficient.The thread function will spend lots of CPUListing 4.12 Continued05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 86
87 4.4 Synchronization and Critical Sections
whenever the flag is not set, checking and rechecking the flag, each time locking andunlocking the mutex.What you really want is a way to put the thread to sleep whenthe flag is not set, until some circumstance changes that might cause the flag tobecome set.

88 Chapter 4 Threads
A condition variable enables you to implement a condition under which a thread exe-cutes and, inversely, the condition under which the thread is blocked.As long as everythread that potentially changes the sense of the condition uses the condition variableproperly, Linux guarantees that threads blocked on the condition will be unblockedwhen the condition changes.
As with a semaphore, a thread may wait on a condition variable. If thread A waits
on a condition variable, it is blocked until some other thread, thread B, signals thesame condition variable. Unlike a semaphore, a condition variable has no counter ormemory; thread A must wait on the condition variable before thread B signals it. If
thread B signals the condition variable before thread A waits on it, the signal is lost,and thread A blocks until some other thread signals the condition variable again.
This is how you would use a condition variable to make the previous sample more
efficient:
nThe loop in thread_function checks the flag. If the flag is not set, the thread
waits on the condition variable.
nThe set_thread_flag function signals the condition variable after changing the
flag value.That way, if thread_function is blocked on the condition variable, it
will be unblocked and will check the condition again.
There ’s one problem with this:There ’s a race condition between checking the 
flag value and signaling or waiting on the condition variable. Suppose that 
thread_function checked the flag and found that it was not set.At that moment, the
Linux scheduler paused that thread and resumed the main one. By some coincidence,the main thread is in 
set_thread_flag . It sets the flag and then signals the condition
variable. Because no thread is waiting on the condition variable at the time (rememberthat 
thread_function was paused before it could wait on the condition variable), the
signal is lost. Now, when Linux reschedules the other thread, it starts waiting on thecondition variable and may end up blocked forever.
T o solve this problem, we need a way to lock the flag and the condition variable
together with a single mutex. Fortunately, GNU/Linux provides exactly this mecha-nism. Each condition variable must be used in conjunction with a mutex, to preventthis sort of race condition. Using this scheme, the thread function follows these steps:
1. The loop in 
thread_function locks the mutex and reads the flag value.
2. If the flag is set, it unlocks the mutex and executes the work function.3. If the flag is not set, it atomically unlocks the mutex and waits on the condition
variable.
The critical feature here is in step 3, in which GNU/Linux allows you to unlock themutex and wait on the condition variable atomically, without the possibility ofanother thread intervening.This eliminates the possibility that another thread maychange the flag value and signal the condition variable in between 
thread_function ’s
test of the flag value and wait on the condition variable.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 88
89 4.4 Synchronization and Critical Sections
A condition variable is represented by an instance of pthread_cond_t . Remember
that each condition variable should be accompanied by a mutex.These are the func-tions that manipulate condition variables:
npthread_cond_init initializes a condition variable.The first argument is a
pointer to a pthread_cond_t instance.The second argument, a pointer to a con-
dition variable attribute object, is ignored under GNU/Linux.The mutex must be initialized separately, as described in Section 4.4.2,“Mutexes. ”
npthread_cond_signal signals a condition variable.A single thread that is blocked
on the condition variable will be unblocked. If no other thread is blocked onthe condition variable, the signal is ignored.The argument is a pointer to the
pthread_cond_t instance.
A similar call, pthread_cond_broadcast , unblocks allthreads that are blocked on
the condition variable, instead of just one.
npthread_cond_wait blocks the calling thread until the condition variable is sig-
naled.The argument is a pointer to the pthread_cond_t instance.The second
argument is a pointer to the pthread_mutex_t mutex instance.
When pthread_cond_wait is called, the mutex must already be locked by the
calling thread.That function atomically unlocks the mutex and blocks on thecondition variable.When the condition variable is signaled and the calling threadunblocks,
pthread_cond_wait automatically reacquires a lock on the mutex.
Whenever your program performs an action that may change the sense of the condi-tion you ’re protecting with the condition variable, it should perform these steps. (In
our example, the condition is the state of the thread flag, so these steps must be takenwhenever the flag is changed.)
1. Lock the mutex accompanying the condition variable.2. Take the action that may change the sense of the condition (in our example, set
the flag).
3. Signal or broadcast the condition variable, depending on the desired behavior.4. Unlock the mutex accompanying the condition variable.
Listing 4.14 shows the previous example again, now using a condition variable to protect the thread flag. Note that in 
thread_function , a lock on the mutex is held
before checking the value of thread_flag .That lock is automatically released by
pthread_cond_wait before blocking and is automatically reacquired afterward.Also
note that set_thread_flag locks the mutex before setting the value of thread_flag
and signaling the mutex.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 89

}
The condition protected by a condition variable can be arbitrarily complex. However,before performing any operation that may change the sense of the condition, a mutexlock should be required, and the condition variable should be signaled afterward.
A condition variable may also be used without a condition, simply as a mechanism
for blocking a thread until another thread “wakes it up. ”A semaphore may also be
used for that purpose.The principal difference is that a semaphore “remembers ”the
wake-up call even if no thread was blocked on it at the time, while a condition variable discards the wake-up call unless some thread is actually blocked on it at the time.Also, a semaphore delivers only a single wake-up per post; with
pthread_cond_broadcast , an arbitrary and unknown number of blocked threads 
may be awoken at the same time.
4.4.7 Deadlocks with Two or More Threads
Deadlocks can occur when two (or more) threads are each blocked, waiting for a con-dition to occur that only the other one can cause. For instance, if thread A is blockedon a condition variable waiting for thread B to signal it, and thread B is blocked on acondition variable waiting for thread A to signal it, a deadlock has occurred becauseneither thread will ever signal the other.Y ou should take care to avoid the possibilityof such situations because they are quite difficult to detect.
One common error that can cause a deadlock involves a problem in which more
than one thread is trying to lock the same set of objects. For example, consider a pro-gram in which two different threads, running two different thread functions, need tolock the same two mutexes. Suppose that thread A locks mutex 1 and then mutex 2,and thread B happens to lock mutex 2 before mutex 1. In a sufficiently unfortunatescheduling scenario, Linux may schedule thread A long enough to lock mutex 1, andthen schedule thread B, which promptly locks mutex 2. Now neither thread canprogress because each is blocked on a mutex that the other thread holds locked.
This is an example of a more general deadlock problem, which can involve not
only synchronization objects such as mutexes, but also other resources, such as lockson files or devices.The problem occurs when multiple threads try to lock the same setof resources in different orders.The solution is to make sure that all threads that lockmore than one resource lock them in the same order.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 91
92 Chapter 4 Threads
4.5 GNU/Linux Thread Implementation
The implementation of POSIX threads on GNU/Linux differs from the thread imple-mentation on many other UNIX-like systems in an important way: on GNU/Linux,threads are implemented as processes.Whenever you call 
pthread_create to create a
new thread, Linux creates a new process that runs that thread. However, this process isnot the same as a process you would create with 
fork; in particular, it shares the same
address space and resources as the original process rather than receiving copies.
The program thread-pid shown in Listing 4.15 demonstrates this.The program
creates a thread; both the original thread and the new one call the getpid function
and print their respective process IDs and then spin infinitely.
Listing 4.15 (thread-pid ) Print Process IDs for Threads
#include <pthread.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <unistd.h>void* thread_function (void* arg){
fprintf (stderr, “child thread pid is %d\n”, (int) getpid ());/* Spin forever.  */while (1);return NULL;
}int main (){
pthread_t thread;fprintf (stderr, “main thread pid is %d\n”, (int) getpid ());pthread_create (&thread, NULL, &thread_function, NULL);/* Spin forever.  */while (1);return 0;
}
Run the program in the background, and then invoke ps x to display your running
processes. Don ’t forget to kill the thread-pid program afterward —it consumes lots of
CPU doing nothing. Here ’s what the output might look like:
% cc thread-pid.c -o thread-pid -lpthread% ./thread-pid &[1] 14608main thread pid is 14608child thread pid is 14610% ps x

Job Control Notification in the Shell
The lines starting with [1] are from the shell. When you run a program in the background, the shell
assigns a job number to it—in this case, 1—and prints out the program’s pid. If a background job termi-nates, the shell reports that fact the next time you invoke a command.
Notice that there are three processes running the thread-pid program.The first of
these, with pid 14608, is the main thread in the program; the third, with pid 14610, isthe thread we created to execute 
thread_function .
How about the second thread, with pid 14609? This is the “manager thread, ”which
is part of the internal implementation of GNU/Linux threads.The manager thread iscreated the first time a program calls 
pthread_create to create a new thread.
4.5.1 Signal Handling
Suppose that a multithreaded program receives a signal. In which thread is the signalhandler invoked? The behavior of the interaction between signals and threads variesfrom one UNIX-like system to another. In GNU/Linux, the behavior is dictated bythe fact that threads are implemented as processes.
Because each thread is a separate process, and because a signal is delivered to a par-
ticular process, there is no ambiguity about which thread receives the signal.T ypically,signals sent from outside the program are sent to the process corresponding to themain thread of the program. For instance, if a program forks and the child processexecs a multithreaded program, the parent process will hold the process id of the mainthread of the child process ’s program and will use that process id to send signals to its
child.This is generally a good convention to follow yourself when sending signals to amultithreaded program.
Note that this aspect of GNU/Linux ’s implementation of pthreads is at variance
with the POSIX thread standard. Do not rely on this behavior in programs that aremeant to be portable.
Within a multithreaded program, it is possible for one thread to send a signal
specifically to another thread. Use the 
pthread_kill function to do this. Its first para-
meter is a thread ID, and its second parameter is a signal number.
4.5.2 The cloneSystem Call
Although GNU/Linux threads created in the same program are implemented as sepa-rate processes, they share their virtual memory space and other resources.A childprocess created with 
fork, however, gets copies of these items. How is the former type
of process created? 05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 93
94 Chapter 4 Threads
The Linux clone system call is a generalized form of fork and pthread_create that
allows the caller to specify which resources are shared between the calling process andthe newly created process.Also,
clone requires you to specify the memory region for
the execution stack that the new process will use.Although we mention clone here to
satisfy the reader ’s curiosity, that system call should not ordinarily be used in programs.
Use fork to create new processes or pthread_create to create threads.
4.6 Processes Vs.Threads
For some programs that benefit from concurrency, the decision whether to useprocesses or threads can be difficult. Here are some guidelines to help you decidewhich concurrency model best suits your program:
nAll threads in a program must run the same executable.A child process, on theother hand, may run a different executable by calling an 
exec function.
nAn errant thread can harm other threads in the same process because threadsshare the same virtual memory space and other resources. For instance, a wildmemory write through an uninitialized pointer in one thread can corrupt memory visible to another thread.An errant process, on the other hand, cannot do so because each process has acopy of the program ’s memory space.
nCopying memory for a new process adds an additional performance overheadrelative to creating a new thread. However, the copy is performed only whenthe memory is changed, so the penalty is minimal if the child process only readsmemory.
nThreads should be used for programs that need fine-grained parallelism. Forexample, if a problem can be broken into multiple, nearly identical tasks, threadsmay be a good choice. Processes should be used for programs that need coarserparallelism.
nSharing data among threads is trivial because threads share the same memory.(However, great care must be taken to avoid race conditions, as described previ-ously.) Sharing data among processes requires the use of IPC mechanisms, asdescribed in Chapter 5.This can be more cumbersome but makes multipleprocesses less likely to suffer from concurrency bugs.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 94
Interprocess Communication
5
C HAPTER 3,“PROCESSES ,”DISCUSSED THE CREATION OF PROCESSES and showed
how one process can obtain the exit status of a child process.That ’s the simplest form
of communication between two processes, but it ’s by no means the most powerful.The
mechanisms of Chapter 3 don ’t provide any way for the parent to communicate with
the child except via command-line arguments and environment variables, nor any wayfor the child to communicate with the parent except via the child ’s exit status. None
of these mechanisms provides any means for communicating with the child processwhile it is actually running, nor do these mechanisms allow communication with aprocess outside the parent-child relationship.
This chapter describes means for interprocess communication that circumvent these
limitations.We will present various ways for communicating between parents and chil-dren, between “unrelated ”processes, and even between processes on different
machines.
Interprocess communication (IPC) is the transfer of data among processes. For example,
a Web browser may request a Web page from a Web server, which then sends HTMLdata.This transfer of data usually uses sockets in a telephone-like connection. Inanother example, you may want to print the filenames in a directory using a commandsuch as 
ls |lpr.The shell creates an lsprocess and a separate lprprocess, connecting06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 95
96 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
the two with a pipe, represented by the “|”symbol.A pipe permits one-way commu-
nication between two related processes.The lsprocess writes data into the pipe, and
the lprprocess reads data from the pipe.
In this chapter, we discuss five types of interprocess communication:
nShared memory permits processes to communicate by simply reading and writing to a specified memory location.
nMapped memory is similar to shared memory, except that it is associated with afile in the filesystem.
nPipes permit sequential communication from one process to a related process.
nFIFOs are similar to pipes, except that unrelated processes can communicatebecause the pipe is given a name in the filesystem.
nSockets support communication between unrelated processes even on differentcomputers.
These types of IPC differ by the following criteria:
nWhether they restrict communication to related processes (processes with acommon ancestor), to unrelated processes sharing the same filesystem, or to anycomputer connected to a network
nWhether a communicating process is limited to only write data or only read data
nThe number of processes permitted to communicate
nWhether the communicating processes are synchronized by the IPC —for 
example, a reading process halts until data is available to read
In this chapter, we omit discussion of IPC permitting communication only a limitednumber of times, such as communicating via a child ’s exit value.
5.1 Shared Memory
One of the simplest interprocess communication methods is using shared memory.Shared memory allows two or more processes to access the same memory as if they allcalled 
malloc and were returned pointers to the same actual memory.When one
process changes the memory, all the other processes see the modification.
5.1.1 Fast Local Communication
Shared memory is the fastest form of interprocess communication because allprocesses share the same piece of memory.Access to this shared memory is as fast asaccessing a process ’s nonshared memory, and it does not require a system call or entry
to the kernel. It also avoids copying data unnecessarily.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 96
97 5.1 Shared Memory
Because the kernel does not synchronize accesses to shared memory, you must pro-
vide your own synchronization. For example, a process should not read from thememory until after data is written there, and two processes must not write to the samememory location at the same time.A common strategy to avoid these race conditionsis to use semaphores, which are discussed in the next section. Our illustrative pro-grams, though, show just a single process accessing the memory, to focus on the sharedmemory mechanism and to avoid cluttering the sample code with synchronizationlogic.
5.1.2 The Memory Model
T o use a shared memory segment, one process must allocate the segment.Then eachprocess desiring to access the segment must attach the segment.After finishing its useof the segment, each process detaches the segment.At some point, one process mustdeallocate the segment.
Understanding the Linux memory model helps explain the allocation and attach-
ment process. Under Linux, each process ’s virtual memory is split into pages. Each
process maintains a mapping from its memory addresses to these virtual memory pages,which contain the actual data. Even though each process has its own addresses, multipleprocesses ’mappings can point to the same page, permitting sharing of memory.
Memory pages are discussed further in Section 8.8, “The 
mlock Family: Locking
Physical Memory, ”of Chapter 8, “Linux System Calls. ”
Allocating a new shared memory segment causes virtual memory pages to be cre-
ated. Because all processes desire to access the same shared segment, only one processshould allocate a new shared segment.Allocating an existing segment does not createnew pages, but it does return an identifier for the existing pages.T o permit a processto use the shared memory segment, a process attaches it, which adds entries mappingfrom its virtual memory to the segment ’s shared pages.When finished with the seg-
ment, these mapping entries are removed.When no more processes want to accessthese shared memory segments, exactly one process must deallocate the virtual memory pages.
All shared memory segments are allocated as integral multiples of the system ’s page
size, which is the number of bytes in a page of memory. On Linux systems, the page
size is 4KB, but you should obtain this value by calling the 
getpagesize function.
5.1.3 Allocation
A process allocates a shared memory segment using shmget (“SHared Memory
GET”). Its first parameter is an integer key that specifies which segment to create.
Unrelated processes can access the same shared segment by specifying the same keyvalue. Unfortunately, other processes may have also chosen the same fixed key, whichcould lead to conflict. Using the special constant 
IPC_PRIVATE as the key value guaran-
tees that a brand new memory segment is created.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 97
98 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
Its second parameter specifies the number of bytes in the segment. Because seg-
ments are allocated using pages, the number of actually allocated bytes is rounded upto an integral multiple of the page size.
The third parameter is the bitwise or of flag values that specify options to 
shmget .
The flag values include these:
nIPC_CREAT —This flag indicates that a new segment should be created.This per-
mits creating a new segment while specifying a key value.
nIPC_EXCL —This flag, which is always used with IPC_CREAT , causes shmget to fail
if a segment key is specified that already exists.Therefore, it arranges for the call-ing process to have an “exclusive ”segment. If this flag is not given and the key
of an existing segment is used,
shmget returns the existing segment instead of
creating a new one.
nMode flags —This value is made of 9 bits indicating permissions granted to
owner, group, and world to control access to the segment. Execution bits areignored.An easy way to specify permissions is to use the constants defined in
<sys/stat.h> and documented in the section 2 stat man page.1For example,
S_IRUSR and S_IWUSR specify read and write permissions for the owner of the
shared memory segment, and S_IROTH and S_IWOTH specify read and write per-
missions for others.
For example, this invocation of shmget creates a new shared memory segment (or
access to an existing one, if shm_key is already used) that ’s readable and writeable to
the owner but not other users.
int segment_id = shmget (shm_key, getpagesize (),
IPC_CREAT |S_IRUSR |S_IWUSER);
If the call succeeds, shmget returns a segment identifier. If the shared memory segment
already exists, the access permissions are verified and a check is made to ensure thatthe segment is not marked for destruction.
5.1.4 Attachment and Detachment
T o make the shared memory segment available, a process must use shmat ,“SHared
Memory ATtach. ”Pass it the shared memory segment identifier SHMID returned by
shmget .The second argument is a pointer that specifies where in your process ’s address
space you want to map the shared memory; if you specify NULL, Linux will choosean available address.The third argument is a flag, which can include the following:
nSHM_RND indicates that the address specified for the second parameter should be
rounded down to a multiple of the page size. If you don ’t specify this flag, you
must page-align the second argument to shmat yourself.
nSHM_RDONLY indicates that the segment will be only read, not written.
1.These permission bits are the same as those used for files.They are described in Section
10.3, “File System Permissions. ”06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 98
99 5.1 Shared Memory
If the call succeeds, it returns the address of the attached shared segment. Children cre-ated by calls to 
fork inherit attached shared segments; they can detach the shared
memory segments, if desired.
When you ’re finished with a shared memory segment, the segment should be
detached using shmdt (“SHared Memory DeTach ”). Pass it the address returned by
shmat . If the segment has been deallocated and this was the last process using it, it is
removed. Calls to exit and any of the exec family automatically detach segments.
5.1.5 Controlling and Deallocating Shared Memory
The shmctl (“SHared Memory ConTroL ”) call returns information about a shared
memory segment and can modify it.The first parameter is a shared memory segmentidentifier.
T o obtain information about a shared memory segment, pass 
IPC_STAT as the 
second argument and a pointer to a struct shmid_ds .
T o remove a segment, pass IPC_RMID as the second argument, and pass NULL as the
third argument.The segment is removed when the last process that has attached itfinally detaches it.
Each shared memory segment should be explicitly deallocated using 
shmctl when
you’re finished with it, to avoid violating the systemwide limit on the total number of
shared memory segments. Invoking exit and exec detaches memory segments but
does not deallocate them.
See the shmctl man page for a description of other operations you can perform on
shared memory segments.
5.1.6 An Example Program
The program in Listing 5.1 illustrates the use of shared memory.

}
5.1.7 Debugging
The ipcs command provides information on interprocess communication facilities,
including shared segments. Use the -mflag to obtain information about shared 
memory. For example, this code illustrates that one shared memory segment,numbered 1627649, is in use:
% ipcs -m------ Shared Memory Segments --------key       shmid     owner     perms     bytes     nattch    status0x00000000 1627649   user    640       25600     0
If this memory segment was erroneously left behind by a program, you can use the
ipcrm command to remove it.
% ipcrm shm 1627649Listing 5.1 Continued06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 100
101 5.2 Processes Semaphores
5.1.8 Pros and Cons
Shared memory segments permit fast bidirectional communication among any numberof processes. Each user can both read and write, but a program must establish and fol-low some protocol for preventing race conditions such as overwriting informationbefore it is read. Unfortunately, Linux does not strictly guarantee exclusive access evenif you create a new shared segment with 
IPC_PRIVATE .
Also, for multiple processes to use a shared segment, they must make arrangements
to use the same key.
5.2 Processes Semaphores
As noted in the previous section, processes must coordinate access to shared memory.As we discussed in Section 4.4.5, “Semaphores for Threads, ”in Chapter 4, “Threads, ”
semaphores are counters that permit synchronizing multiple threads. Linux provides adistinct alternate implementation of semaphores that can be used for synchronizingprocesses (called process semaphores or sometimes System V semaphores). Process sem-aphores are allocated, used, and deallocated like shared memory segments.Although asingle semaphore is sufficient for almost all uses, process semaphores come in sets.Throughout this section, we present system calls for process semaphores, showing howto implement single binary semaphores using them.
5.2.1 Allocation and Deallocation
The calls semget and semctl allocate and deallocate semaphores, which is analogous to
shmget and shmctl for shared memory. Invoke semget with a key specifying a sema-
phore set, the number of semaphores in the set, and permission flags as for shmget ; the
return value is a semaphore set identifier.Y ou can obtain the identifier of an existingsemaphore set by specifying the right key value; in this case, the number of sema-phores can be zero.
Semaphores continue to exist even after all processes using them have terminated.
The last process to use a semaphore set must explicitly remove it to ensure that theoperating system does not run out of semaphores.T o do so, invoke 
semctl with the
semaphore identifier, the number of semaphores in the set, IPC_RMID as the third argu-
ment, and any union semun value as the fourth argument (which is ignored).The
effective user ID of the calling process must match that of the semaphore ’s allocator
(or the caller must be root). Unlike shared memory segments, removing a semaphore
set causes Linux to deallocate immediately.
Listing 5.2 presents functions to allocate and deallocate a binary semaphore.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 101

};/* Obtain a binary semaphore’s ID, allocating if necessary.  */int binary_semaphore_allocation (key_t key, int sem_flags){
return semget (key, 1, sem_flags);
}/* Deallocate a binary semaphore.  All users must have finished their
use.  Returns -1 on failure.  */
int binary_semaphore_deallocate (int semid){
union semun ignored_argument;return semctl (semid, 1, IPC_RMID, ignored_argument);
}
5.2.2 Initializing Semaphores
Allocating and initializing semaphores are two separate operations.T o initialize a sema-phore, use 
semctl with zero as the second argument and SETALL as the third argument.
For the fourth argument, you must create a union semun object and point its array
field at an array of unsigned short values. Each value is used to initialize one sema-phore in the set.
Listing 5.3 presents a function that initializes a binary semaphore.

union semun argument;unsigned short values[1];values[0] = 1;argument.array = values;return semctl (semid, 0, SETALL, argument);
}
5.2.3 Wait and Post Operations
Each semaphore has a non-negative value and supports wait and post operations.The
semop system call implements both operations. Its first parameter specifies a semaphore
set identifier. Its second parameter is an array of struct sembuf elements, which specify
the operations you want to perform.The third parameter is the length of this array.
The fields of struct sembuf are listed here:
nsem_num is the semaphore number in the semaphore set on which the operation
is performed.
nsem_op is an integer that specifies the semaphore operation.
If sem_op is a positive number, that number is added to the semaphore value
immediately.If 
sem_op is a negative number, the absolute value of that number is subtracted
from the semaphore value. If this would make the semaphore value negative, thecall blocks until the semaphore value becomes as large as the absolute value of
sem_op (because some other process increments it).
If sem_op is zero, the operation blocks until the semaphore value becomes zero.
nsem_flg is a flag value. Specify IPC_NOWAIT to prevent the operation from 
blocking; if the operation would have blocked, the call to semop fails instead.
If you specify SEM_UNDO , Linux automatically undoes the operation on the 
semaphore when the process exits.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 103

int binary_semaphore_wait (int semid){
struct sembuf operations[1];/* Use the first (and only) semaphore.  */operations[0].sem_num = 0;/* Decrement by 1.  */operations[0].sem_op = -1;/* Permit undo’ing.  */operations[0].sem_flg = SEM_UNDO;return semop (semid, operations, 1);

}
Specifying the SEM_UNDO flag permits dealing with the problem of terminating a
process while it has resources allocated through a semaphore.When a process termi-nates, either voluntarily or involuntarily, the semaphore ’s values are automatically
adjusted to “undo”the process ’s effects on the semaphore. For example, if a process
that has decremented a semaphore is killed, the semaphore ’s value is incremented.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 104

5.2.4 Debugging Semaphores
Use the command ipcs -s to display information about existing semaphore sets. Use
the ipcrm sem command to remove a semaphore set from the command line. For
example, to remove the semaphore set with identifier 5790517, use this line:
% ipcrm sem 5790517
5.3 Mapped Memory
Mapped memory permits different processes to communicate via a shared file.Although you can think of mapped memory as using a shared memory segment with a name, you should be aware that there are technical differences. Mapped memory can be used for interprocess communication or as an easy way to access the contents of a file.
Mapped memory forms an association between a file and a process ’s memory.
Linux splits the file into page-sized chunks and then copies them into virtual memorypages so that they can be made available in a process ’s address space.Thus, the process
can read the file ’s contents with ordinary memory access. It can also modify the file ’s
contents by writing to memory.This permits fast access to files.
Y ou can think of mapped memory as allocating a buffer to hold a file ’s entire con-
tents, and then reading the file into the buffer and (if the buffer is modified) writingthe buffer back out to the file afterward. Linux handles the file reading and writingoperations for you.
There are uses for memory-mapped files other than interprocess communication.
Some of these are discussed in Section 5.3.5, “Other Uses for 
mmap.”
5.3.1 Mapping an Ordinary File
T o map an ordinary file to a process ’s memory, use the mmap (“Memory MAPped, ”
pronounced “em-map ”) call.The first argument is the address at which you would like
Linux to map the file into your process ’s address space; the value NULL allows Linux
to choose an available start address.The second argument is the length of the map inbytes.The third argument specifies the protection on the mapped address range.Theprotection consists of a bitwise “or”of 
PROT_READ ,PROT_WRITE , and PROT_EXEC , corre-
sponding to read, write, and execution permission, respectively.The fourth argument isa flag value that specifies additional options.The fifth argument is a file descriptoropened to the file to be mapped.The last argument is the offset from the beginning ofthe file from which to start the map.Y ou can map all or part of the file into memoryby choosing the starting offset and length appropriately.
The flag value is a bitwise “or”of these constraints:
nMAP_FIXED —If you specify this flag, Linux uses the address you request to map
the file rather than treating it as a hint.This address must be page-aligned.
nMAP_PRIVATE —Writes to the memory range should not be written back to the
attached file, but to a private copy of the file. No other process sees these writes.This mode may not be used with 
MAP_SHARED .06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 105
106 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
nMAP_SHARED —Writes are immediately reflected in the underlying file rather than
buffering writes. Use this mode when using mapped memory for IPC.Thismode may not be used with 
MAP_PRIVATE .
If the call succeeds, it returns a pointer to the beginning of the memory. On failure, itreturns 
MAP_FAILED .
When you ’re finished with a memory mapping, release it by using munmap . Pass it
the start address and length of the mapped memory region. Linux automaticallyunmaps mapped regions when a process terminates.
5.3.2 Example Programs
Let’s look at two programs to illustrate using memory-mapped regions to read and
write to files.The first program, Listing 5.5, generates a random number and writes itto a memory-mapped file.The second program, Listing 5.6, reads the number, printsit, and replaces it in the memory-mapped file with double the value. Both take a command-line argument of the file to map.
Listing 5.5 (mmap-write.c ) Write a Random Number to a Memory-Mapped File
#include <stdlib.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <fcntl.h>#include <sys/mman.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <time.h>#include <unistd.h>#define FILE_LENGTH 0x100/* Return a uniformly random number in the range [low,high].  */int random_range (unsigned const low, unsigned const high){
unsigned const range = high - low + 1;return low + (int) (((double) range) * rand () / (RAND_MAX + 1.0));
}int main (int argc, char* const argv[]){
int fd;void* file_memory;/* Seed the random number generator.  */srand (time (NULL));/* Prepare a file large enough to hold an unsigned integer.  */fd = open (argv[1], O_RDWR 
|O_CREAT, S_IRUSR |S_IWUSR);
lseek (fd, FILE_LENGTH+1, SEEK_SET);06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 106
107 5.3 Mapped Memory
write (fd, “”, 1);lseek (fd, 0, SEEK_SET);/* Create the memory mapping.  */file_memory = mmap (0, FILE_LENGTH, PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);close (fd);/* Write a random integer to memory-mapped area.  */sprintf((char*) file_memory, “%d\n”, random_range (-100, 100));/* Release the memory (unnecessary because the program exits).  */munmap (file_memory, FILE_LENGTH);return 0;
}
The mmap-write program opens the file, creating it if it did not previously exist.The
third argument to open specifies that the file is opened for reading and writing.
Because we do not know the file ’s length, we use lseek to ensure that the file is large
enough to store an integer and then move back the file position to its beginning.
The program maps the file and then closes the file descriptor because it ’s no longer
needed.The program then writes a random integer to the mapped memory, and thusthe file, and unmaps the memory.The 
munmap call is unnecessary because Linux would
automatically unmap the file when the program terminates.
Listing 5.6 (mmap-read.c ) Read an Integer from a Memory-Mapped File, and
Double It
#include <stdlib.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <fcntl.h>#include <sys/mman.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <unistd.h>#define FILE_LENGTH 0x100int main (int argc, char* const argv[]){
int fd;void* file_memory;int integer;/* Open the file.  */fd = open (argv[1], O_RDWR, S_IRUSR 
|S_IWUSR);
/* Create the memory mapping.  */file_memory = mmap (0, FILE_LENGTH, PROT_READ 
|PROT_WRITE,
MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
close (fd);
continues06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 107
108 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
/* Read the integer, print it out, and double it.  */scanf (file_memory, “%d”, &integer);printf (“value: %d\n”, integer);sprintf ((char*) file_memory, “%d\n”, 2 * integer);/* Release the memory (unnecessary because the program exits).  */munmap (file_memory, FILE_LENGTH);return 0;
}
The mmap-read program reads the number out of the file and then writes the doubled
value to the file. First, it opens the file and maps it for reading and writing. Becausewe can assume that the file is large enough to store an unsigned integer, we need notuse 
lseek , as in the previous program.The program reads and parses the value out 
of memory using sscanf and then formats and writes the double value using sprintf .
Here’s an example of running these example programs. It maps the file 
/tmp/integer-file .
% ./mmap-write /tmp/integer-file% cat /tmp/integer-file42% ./mmap-read /tmp/integer-filevalue: 42% cat /tmp/integer-file84
Observe that the text 42was written to the disk file without ever calling write , and
was read back in again without calling read. Note that these sample programs write
and read the integer as a string (using sprintf and sscanf ) for demonstration purposes
only—there’s no need for the contents of a memory-mapped file to be text.Y ou can
store and retrieve arbitrary binary in a memory-mapped file.
5.3.3 Shared Access to a File
Different processes can communicate using memory-mapped regions associated withthe same file. Specify the 
MAP_SHARED flag so that any writes to these regions are
immediately transferred to the underlying file and made visible to other processes.If you don ’t specify this flag, Linux may buffer writes before transferring them to 
the file.
Alternatively, you can force Linux to incorporate buffered writes into the disk file
by calling 
msync . Its first two parameters specify a memory-mapped region, as for 
munmap .The third parameter can take these flag values:
nMS_ASYNC —The update is scheduled but not necessarily run before the call
returns.
nMS_SYNC —The update is immediate; the call to msync blocks until it ’s done.
MS_SYNC and MS_ASYNC may not both be used.Listing 5.6 Continued06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 108
109 5.3 Mapped Memory
nMS_INVALIDATE —All other file mappings are invalidated so that they can see the
updated values.
For example, to flush a shared file mapped at address mem_addr of length mem_length
bytes, call this:
msync (mem_addr, mem_length, MS_SYNC |MS_INVALIDATE);
As with shared memory segments, users of memory-mapped regions must establishand follow a protocol to avoid race conditions. For example, a semaphore can be usedto prevent more than one process from accessing the mapped memory at one time.Alternatively, you can use 
fcntl to place a read or write lock on the file, as described
in Section 8.3, “fcntl : Locks and Other File Operations, ”in Chapter 8.
5.3.4 Private Mappings
Specifying MAP_PRIVATE to mmap creates a copy-on-write region.Any write to the
region is reflected only in this process ’s memory; other processes that map the same
file won ’t see the changes. Instead of writing directly to a page shared by all processes,
the process writes to a private copy of this page.All subsequent reading and writing bythe process use this page.
5.3.5 Other Uses for mmap
The mmap call can be used for purposes other than interprocess communications. One
common use is as a replacement for read and write . For example, rather than explic-
itly reading a file ’s contents into memory, a program might map the file into memory
and scan it using memory reads. For some programs, this is more convenient and mayalso run faster than explicit file I/O operations.
One advanced and powerful technique used by some programs is to build data
structures (ordinary 
struct instances, for example) in a memory-mapped file. On a
subsequent invocation, the program maps that file back into memory, and the datastructures are restored to their previous state. Note, though, that pointers in these datastructures will be invalid unless they all point within the same mapped region ofmemory and unless care is taken to map the file back into the same address regionthat it occupied originally.
Another handy technique is to map the special 
/dev/zero file into memory.That
file, which is described in Section 6.5.2, “/dev/zero, ”of Chapter 6, “Devices, ”behaves
as if it were an infinitely long file filled with 0 bytes.A program that needs a source of0 bytes can 
mmap the file /dev/zero .Writes to /dev/zero are discarded, so the mapped
memory may be used for any purpose. Custom memory allocators often map
/dev/zero to obtain chunks of preinitialized memory.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:22 AM  Page 109
110 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
5.4 Pipes
A pipeis a communication device that permits unidirectional communication. Data
written to the “write end ”of the pipe is read back from the “read end. ”Pipes are 
serial devices; the data is always read from the pipe in the same order it was written.T ypically, a pipe is used to communicate between two threads in a single process orbetween parent and child processes.
In a shell, the symbol 
|creates a pipe. For example, this shell command causes the
shell to produce two child processes, one for lsand one for less:
% ls |less
The shell also creates a pipe connecting the standard output of the lssubprocess with
the standard input of the less process.The filenames listed by lsare sent to less in
exactly the same order as if they were sent directly to the terminal.
A pipe ’s data capacity is limited. If the writer process writes faster than the reader
process consumes the data, and if the pipe cannot store more data, the writer processblocks until more capacity becomes available. If the reader tries to read but no data isavailable, it blocks until data becomes available.Thus, the pipe automatically synchro-nizes the two processes.
5.4.1 Creating Pipes
T o create a pipe, invoke the pipe command. Supply an integer array of size 2.The call
to pipe stores the reading file descriptor in array position 0 and the writing file
descriptor in position 1. For example, consider this code:
int pipe_fds[2];int read_fd;int write_fd;pipe (pipe_fds);read_fd = pipe_fds[0];write_fd = pipe_fds[1];
Data written to the file descriptor read_fd can be read back from write_fd .
5.4.2 Communication Between Parent and Child Processes
A call to pipe creates file descriptors, which are valid only within that process and its
children.A process ’s file descriptors cannot be passed to unrelated processes; however,
when the process calls fork, file descriptors are copied to the new child process.Thus,
pipes can connect only related processes.
In the program in Listing 5.7, a fork spawns a child process.The child inherits the
pipe file descriptors.The parent writes a string to the pipe, and the child reads it out.The sample program converts these file descriptors into 
FILE* streams using fdopen .
Because we use streams rather than file descriptors, we can use the higher-level standard C library I/O functions such as 
printf and fgets .06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 110
111 5.4 Pipes
Listing 5.7 (pipe.c) Using a Pipe to Communicate with a Child Process

between each.  */
void writer (const char* message, int count, FILE* stream){
for (; count > 0; --count) {
/* Write the message to the stream, and send it off immediately.  */fprintf (stream, “%s\n”, message);fflush (stream);/* Snooze a while.  */sleep (1);
}
}/* Read random strings from the stream as long as possible.  */void reader (FILE* stream){
char buffer[1024];/* Read until we hit the end of the stream.  fgets reads until
either a newline or the end-of-file.  */
while (!feof (stream)
&& !ferror (stream)&& fgets (buffer, sizeof (buffer), stream) != NULL)
fputs (buffer, stdout);
}int main (){
int fds[2];pid_t pid;/* Create a pipe.  File descriptors for the two ends of the pipe are
placed in fds.  */
pipe (fds);/* Fork a child process.  */pid = fork ();if (pid == (pid_t) 0) {
FILE* stream;/* This is the child process.  Close our copy of the write end of
the file descriptor.  */
close (fds[1]);/* Convert the read file descriptor to a FILE object, and read
from it.  */
stream = fdopen (fds[0], “r”);reader (stream);
continues06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 111
112 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
close (fds[0]);
}else {
/* This is the parent process.  */FILE* stream;/* Close our copy of the read end of the file descriptor.  */close (fds[0]);/* Convert the write file descriptor to a FILE object, and write
to it.  */
stream = fdopen (fds[1], “w”);writer (“Hello, world.”, 5, stream);close (fds[1]);
}return 0;
}
At the beginning of main,fdsis declared to be an integer array with size 2.The pipe
call creates a pipe and places the read and write file descriptors in that array.The pro-gram then forks a child process.After closing the read end of the pipe, the parentprocess starts writing strings to the pipe.After closing the write end of the pipe, thechild reads strings from the pipe.
Note that after writing in the 
writer function, the parent flushes the pipe by 
calling fflush . Otherwise, the string may not be sent through the pipe immediately.
When you invoke the command ls |less, two forks occur: one for the lschild
process and one for the less child process. Both of these processes inherit the pipe file
descriptors so they can communicate using a pipe.T o have unrelated processes com-municate, use a FIFO instead, as discussed in Section 5.4.5, “FIFOs. ”
5.4.3 Redirecting the Standard Input, Output, and ErrorStreams
Frequently, you ’ll want to create a child process and set up one end of a pipe as its
standard input or standard output. Using the dup2 call, you can equate one file
descriptor with another. For example, to redirect a process ’s standard input to a file
descriptor fd, use this line:
dup2 (fd, STDIN_FILENO);
The symbolic constant STDIN_FILENO represents the file descriptor for the standard
input, which has the value 0.The call closes standard input and then reopens it as aduplicate of 
fdso that the two may be used interchangeably. Equated file descriptors
share the same file position and the same set of file status flags.Thus, characters readfrom 
fdare not reread from standard input.Listing 5.7 Continued06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 112
113 5.4 Pipes
The program in Listing 5.8 uses dup2 to send the output from a pipe to the sort
command.2After creating a pipe, the program forks.The parent process prints some
strings to the pipe.The child process attaches the read file descriptor of the pipe to itsstandard input using 
dup2. It then executes the sort program.
Listing 5.8 (dup2.c ) Redirect Output from a Pipe with dup2
#include <stdio.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <sys/wait.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (){
int fds[2];pid_t pid;/* Create a pipe.  File descriptors for the two ends of the pipe are
placed in fds.  */
pipe (fds);/* Fork a child process.  */pid = fork ();if (pid == (pid_t) 0) {
/* This is the child process.  Close our copy of the write end of
the file descriptor.  */
close (fds[1]);/* Connect the read end of the pipe to standard input.  */dup2 (fds[0], STDIN_FILENO);/* Replace the child process with the “sort” program.  */execlp (“sort”, “sort”, 0);
}else {
/* This is the parent process.  */FILE* stream;/* Close our copy of the read end of the file descriptor.  */close (fds[0]);/* Convert the write file descriptor to a FILE object, and write
to it.  */
stream = fdopen (fds[1], “w”);fprintf (stream, “This is a test.\n”);fprintf (stream, “Hello, world.\n”);fprintf (stream, “My dog has fleas.\n”);fprintf (stream, “This program is great.\n”);fprintf (stream, “One fish, two fish.\n”);fflush (stream);close (fds[1]);/* Wait for the child process to finish.  */waitpid (pid, NULL, 0);
}return 0;
}

them to standard output.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 113
114 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
5.4.4 popen and pclose
A common use of pipes is to send data to or receive data from a program being run ina subprocess.The 
popen and pclose functions ease this paradigm by eliminating the
need to invoke pipe,fork,dup2,exec, and fdopen .
Compare Listing 5.9, which uses popen and pclose , to the previous example
(Listing 5.8).
Listing 5.9 (popen.c ) Example Using popen
#include <stdio.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (){
FILE* stream = popen (“sort”, “w”);fprintf (stream, “This is a test.\n”);fprintf (stream, “Hello, world.\n”);fprintf (stream, “My dog has fleas.\n”);fprintf (stream, “This program is great.\n”);fprintf (stream, “One fish, two fish.\n”);return pclose (stream);
}
The call to popen creates a child process executing the sort command, replacing calls
to pipe,fork,dup2, and execlp .The second argument, “w”, indicates that this process
wants to write to the child process.The return value from popen is one end of a pipe;
the other end is connected to the child process ’s standard input.After the writing fin-
ishes,pclose closes the child process ’s stream, waits for the process to terminate, and
returns its status value.
The first argument to popen is executed as a shell command in a subprocess run-
ning /bin/sh .The shell searches the PATH environment variable in the usual way to
find programs to execute. If the second argument is “r”, the function returns the child
process ’s standard output stream so that the parent can read the output. If the second
argument is “w”, the function returns the child process ’s standard input stream so that
the parent can send data. If an error occurs, popen returns a null pointer.
Call pclose to close a stream returned by popen .After closing the specified stream,
pclose waits for the child process to terminate.
5.4.5 FIFOs
A first-in, first-out (FIFO) file is a pipe that has a name in the filesystem.Any process
can open or close the FIFO; the processes on either end of the pipe need not berelated to each other. FIFOs are also called named pipes .06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 114
115 5.4 Pipes
Y ou can make a FIFO using the mkfifo command. Specify the path to the FIFO
on the command line. For example, create a FIFO in /tmp/fifo by invoking this:
% mkfifo /tmp/fifo% ls -l /tmp/fifoprw-rw-rw-    1 samuel   users           0 Jan 16 14:04 /tmp/fifo
The first character of the output from lsis p, indicating that this file is actually a
FIFO (named pipe). In one window, read from the FIFO by invoking the following:
% cat < /tmp/fifo
In a second window, write to the FIFO by invoking this:
% cat > /tmp/fifo
Then type in some lines of text. Each time you press Enter, the line of text is sentthrough the FIFO and appears in the first window. Close the FIFO by pressingCtrl+D in the second window. Remove the FIFO with this line:
% rm /tmp/fifo
Creating a FIFOCreate a FIFO programmatically using the 
mkfifo function.The first argument is the
path at which to create the FIFO; the second parameter specifies the pipe ’s owner,
group, and world permissions, as discussed in Chapter 10, “Security, ”Section 10.3,
“File System Permissions. ”Because a pipe must have a reader and a writer, the permis-
sions must include both read and write permissions. If the pipe cannot be created (for instance, if a file with that name already exists),
mkfifo returns –1. Include
<sys/types.h> and <sys/stat.h> if you call mkfifo .
Accessing a FIFOAccess a FIFO just like an ordinary file.T o communicate through a FIFO, one pro-gram must open it for writing, and another program must open it for reading. Eitherlow-level I/O functions (
open,write ,read,close , and so on, as listed in Appendix B,
“Low-Level I/O ”) or C library I/O functions ( fopen ,fprintf ,fscanf ,fclose , and so
on) may be used.
For example, to write a buffer of data to a FIFO using low-level I/O routines, you
could use this code:
int fd = open (fifo_path, O_WRONLY);write (fd, data, data_length);close (fd);
T o read a string from the FIFO using C library I/O functions, you could use this code:
FILE* fifo = fopen (fifo_path, “r”);fscanf (fifo, “%s”, buffer);fclose (fifo);06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 115
116 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
A FIFO can have multiple readers or multiple writers. Bytes from each writer arewritten atomically up to a maximum size of 
PIPE_BUF (4KB on Linux). Chunks from
simultaneous writers can be interleaved. Similar rules apply to simultaneous reads.Differences from Windows Named PipesPipes in the Win32 operating systems are very similar to Linux pipes. (Refer to theWin32 library documentation for technical details about these.) The main differencesconcern named pipes, which, for Win32, function more like sockets.Win32 namedpipes can connect processes on separate computers connected via a network. OnLinux, sockets are used for this purpose.Also,Win32 allows multiple reader-writerconnections on a named pipe without interleaving data, and pipes can be used fortwo-way communication.

5.5 Sockets
A socket is a bidirectional communication device that can be used to communicate with
another process on the same machine or with a process running on other machines.Sockets are the only interprocess communication we ’ll discuss in this chapter that 
permit communication between processes on different computers. Internet programssuch as T elnet, rlogin, FTP , talk, and the World Wide Web use sockets.
For example, you can obtain the WWW page from a Web server using the 
T elnet program because they both use sockets for network communications.
4
T o open a connection to a WWW server at www.codesourcery.com , use 
telnet www.codesourcery.com 80 .The magic constant 80 specifies a connection to
the Web server programming running www.codesourcery.com instead of some other
process.Try typing GET / after the connection is established.This sends a message
through the socket to the Web server, which replies by sending the home page ’s
HTML source and then closing the connection —for example:
% telnet www.codesourcery.com 80Trying 206.168.99.1...Connected to merlin.codesourcery.com (206.168.99.1).Escape character is ‘^]’.GET /<html><head>
<meta http-equiv=”Content-Type” content=”text/html; charset=iso-8859-1”>
...
3. Note that only Windows NT can create a named pipe;Windows 9 xprograms can form
only client connections.
4. Usually, you ’d use telnet to connect a T elnet server for remote logins. But you can also use
telnet to connect to a server of a different kind and then type comments directly at it.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 116
117 5.5 Sockets
5.5.1 Socket Concepts
When you create a socket, you must specify three parameters: communication style,namespace, and protocol.
A communication style controls how the socket treats transmitted data and specifies
the number of communication partners.When data is sent through a socket, it is pack-aged into chunks called packets .The communication style determines how these 
packets are handled and how they are addressed from the sender to the receiver.
nConnection styles guarantee delivery of all packets in the order they were sent. If
packets are lost or reordered by problems in the network, the receiver automati-cally requests their retransmission from the sender.A connection-style socket is like a telephone call:The addresses of the senderand receiver are fixed at the beginning of the communication when the connec-tion is established.
nDatagram styles do not guarantee delivery or arrival order. Packets may be lost or
reordered in transit due to network errors or other conditions. Each packet mustbe labeled with its destination and is not guaranteed to be delivered.The systemguarantees only “best effort, ”so packets may disappear or arrive in a different
order than shipping.A datagram-style socket behaves more like postal mail.The sender specifies thereceiver ’s address for each individual message.
A socket namespace specifies how socket addresses are written.A socket address identi-
fies one end of a socket connection. For example, socket addresses in the “local name-
space”are ordinary filenames. In “Internet namespace, ”a socket address is composed of
the Internet address (also known as an Internet Protocol address or IP address ) of a host
attached to the network and a port number.The port number distinguishes amongmultiple sockets on the same host.
A protocol specifies how data is transmitted. Some protocols are TCP/IP , the pri-
mary networking protocols used by the Internet; the AppleTalk network protocol; andthe UNIX local communication protocol. Not all combinations of styles, namespaces,and protocols are supported.
5.5.2 System Calls
Sockets are more flexible than previously discussed communication techniques.Theseare the system calls involving sockets:
socket —Creates a socket
closes —Destroys a socket
connect —Creates a connection between two sockets
bind—Labels a server socket with an address
listen —Configures a socket to accept conditions
accept —Accepts a connection and creates a new socket for the connection
Sockets are represented by file descriptors.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 117
118 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
Creating and Destroying SocketsThe 
socket and close functions create and destroy sockets, respectively.When you
create a socket, specify the three socket choices: namespace, communication style, andprotocol. For the namespace parameter, use constants beginning with 
PF_(abbreviating
“protocol families ”). For example, PF_LOCAL or PF_UNIX specifies the local namespace,
and PF_INET specifies Internet namespaces. For the communication style parameter, use
constants beginning with SOCK_ .U s e  SOCK_STREAM for a connection-style socket, or use
SOCK_DGRAM for a datagram-style socket.
The third parameter, the protocol, specifies the low-level mechanism to transmit
and receive data. Each protocol is valid for a particular namespace-style combination.Because there is usually one best protocol for each such pair, specifying 0 is usually thecorrect protocol. If 
socket succeeds, it returns a file descriptor for the socket.Y ou can
read from or write to the socket using read,write , and so on, as with other file
descriptors.When you are finished with a socket, call close to remove it.
Calling connect
T o create a connection between two sockets, the client calls connect , specifying the
address of a server socket to connect to.A client is the process initiating the connec-
tion, and a server is the process waiting to accept connections.The client calls connect
to initiate a connection from a local socket to the server socket specified by the second argument.The third argument is the length, in bytes, of the address structurepointed to by the second argument. Socket address formats differ according to thesocket namespace.Sending InformationAny technique to write to a file descriptor can be used to write to a socket. SeeAppendix B for a discussion of Linux ’s low-level I/O functions and some of the issues
surrounding their use.The 
send function, which is specific to the socket file descrip-
tors, provides an alternative to write with a few additional choices; see the man page
for information.
5.5.3 Servers
A server ’s life cycle consists of the creation of a connection-style socket, binding an
address to its socket, placing a call to listen that enables connections to the socket,
placing calls to accept incoming connections, and then closing the socket. Data isn ’t
read and written directly via the server socket; instead, each time a program accepts anew connection, Linux creates a separate socket to use in transferring data over thatconnection. In this section, we introduce 
bind,listen , and accept .06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 118
119 5.5 Sockets
An address must be bound to the server ’s socket using bind if a client is to find it.
Its first argument is the socket file descriptor.The second argument is a pointer to asocket address structure; the format of this depends on the socket ’s address family.The
third argument is the length of the address structure, in bytes.When an address isbound to a connection-style socket, it must invoke 
listen to indicate that it is a
server. Its first argument is the socket file descriptor.The second argument specifieshow many pending connections are queued. If the queue is full, additional connec-tions will be rejected.This does not limit the total number of connections that a servercan handle; it limits just the number of clients attempting to connect that have not yetbeen accepted.
A server accepts a connection request from a client by invoking 
accept . The first
argument is the socket file descriptor.The second argument points to a socket addressstructure, which is filled with the client socket ’s address.The third argument is the
length, in bytes, of the socket address structure.The server can use the client address todetermine whether it really wants to communicate with the client.The call to acceptcreates a new socket for communicating with the client and returns the correspondingfile descriptor.The original server socket continues to accept new client connections.T o read data from a socket without removing it from the input queue, use 
recv.I t
takes the same arguments as read, plus an additional FLAGS argument.A flag of
MSG_PEEK causes data to be read but not removed from the input queue.
5.5.4 Local Sockets
Sockets connecting processes on the same computer can use the local namespace represented by the synonyms 
PF_LOCAL and PF_UNIX .These are called local sockets or
UNIX-domain sockets .Their socket addresses, specified by filenames, are used only when
creating connections.
The socket ’s name is specified in struct sockaddr_un .Y ou must set the sun_family
field to AF_LOCAL , indicating that this is a local namespace.The sun_path field specifies
the filename to use and may be, at most, 108 bytes long.The actual length of 
struct sockaddr_un should be computed using the SUN_LEN macro.Any filename can
be used, but the process must have directory write permissions, which permit addingfiles to the directory.T o connect to a socket, a process must have read permission forthe file. Even though different computers may share the same filesystem, only processesrunning on the same computer can communicate with local namespace sockets.
The only permissible protocol for the local namespace is 0.Because it resides in a file system, a local socket is listed as a file. For example,
notice the initial 
s:
% ls -l /tmp/socketsrwxrwx--x    1 user   group    0 Nov 13 19:18 /tmp/socket
Call unlink to remove a local socket when you ’re done with it.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 119
120 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
5.5.5 An Example Using Local Namespace Sockets
We illustrate sockets with two programs.The server program, in Listing 5.10, creates alocal namespace socket and listens for connections on it.When it receives a connec-tion, it reads text messages from the connection and prints them until the connectioncloses. If one of these messages is “quit,”the server program removes the socket and
ends.The 
socket-server program takes the path to the socket as its command-line
argument.
Listing 5.10 (socket-server.c ) Local Namespace Socket Server
#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>#include <string.h>#include <sys/socket.h>#include <sys/un.h>#include <unistd.h>/* Read text from the socket and print it out.  Continue until the
socket closes.  Return nonzero if the client sent a “quit”message, zero otherwise.  */
int server (int client_socket){
while (1) {
int length;char* text;/* First, read the length of the text message from the socket.  If
read returns zero, the client closed the connection.  */
if (read (client_socket, &length, sizeof (length)) == 0)
return 0;
/* Allocate a buffer to hold the text.  */text = (char*) malloc (length);/* Read the text itself, and print it.  */read (client_socket, text, length);printf (“%s\n”, text);/* Free the buffer.  */free (text);/* If the client sent the message “quit,” we’re all done.  */if (!strcmp (text, “quit”))
return 1;
}
}int main (int argc, char* const argv[]){const char* const socket_name = argv[1];06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 120
121 5.5 Sockets
int socket_fd;struct sockaddr_un name;int client_sent_quit_message;/* Create the socket.  */socket_fd = socket (PF_LOCAL, SOCK_STREAM, 0);/* Indicate that this is a server.  */name.sun_family = AF_LOCAL;strcpy (name.sun_path, socket_name);bind (socket_fd, &name, SUN_LEN (&name));/* Listen for connections.  */listen (socket_fd, 5);/* Repeatedly accept connections, spinning off one server() to deal
with each client.  Continue until a client sends a “quit” message.  */
do {
struct sockaddr_un client_name;socklen_t client_name_len;int client_socket_fd;/* Accept a connection.  */client_socket_fd = accept (socket_fd, &client_name, &client_name_len);/* Handle the connection.  */client_sent_quit_message = server (client_socket_fd);/* Close our end of the connection.  */close (client_socket_fd);
}while (!client_sent_quit_message);/* Remove the socket file.  */close (socket_fd);unlink (socket_name);return 0;
}
The client program, in Listing 5.11, connects to a local namespace socket and sends a message.The name path to the socket and the message are specified on the command line.
Listing 5.11 (socket-client.c ) Local Namespace Socket Client
#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>#include <sys/socket.h>#include <sys/un.h>#include <unistd.h>
continues06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 121
122 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
/* Write TEXT to the socket given by file descriptor SOCKET_FD.  */void write_text (int socket_fd, const char* text){
/* Write the number of bytes in the string, including
NUL-termination.  */
int length = strlen (text) + 1;write (socket_fd, &length, sizeof (length));/* Write the string.  */write (socket_fd, text, length);
}int main (int argc, char* const argv[]){
const char* const socket_name = argv[1];const char* const message = argv[2];int socket_fd;struct sockaddr_un name;/* Create the socket.  */socket_fd = socket (PF_LOCAL, SOCK_STREAM, 0);/* Store the server’s name in the socket address.  */name.sun_family = AF_LOCAL;strcpy (name.sun_path, socket_name);/* Connect the socket.  */connect (socket_fd, &name, SUN_LEN (&name));/* Write the text on the command line to the socket.  */write_text (socket_fd, message);close (socket_fd);return 0;
}
Before the client sends the message text, it sends the length of that text by sending thebytes of the integer variable 
length . Likewise, the server reads the length of the text by
reading from the socket into an integer variable.This allows the server to allocate anappropriately sized buffer to hold the message text before reading it from the socket.
T o try this example, start the server program in one window. Specify a path to a
socket —for example,
/tmp/socket .
% ./socket-server /tmp/socket
In another window, run the client a few times, specifying the same socket path plusmessages to send to the client:
% ./socket-client /tmp/socket “Hello, world.”% ./socket-client /tmp/socket “This is a test.”Listing 5.11 Continued06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 122
123 5.5 Sockets
The server program receives and prints these messages.T o close the server, send themessage “quit”from a client:
% ./socket-client /tmp/socket “quit”
The server program terminates.
5.5.6 Internet-Domain Sockets
UNIX-domain sockets can be used only for communication between two processeson the same computer. Internet-domain sockets , on the other hand, may be used to con-
nect processes on different machines connected by a network.
Sockets connecting processes through the Internet use the Internet namespace rep-
resented by 
PF_INET .The most common protocols are TCP/IP .The Internet Protocol
(IP), a low-level protocol, moves packets through the Internet, splitting and rejoining
the packets, if necessary. It guarantees only “best-effort ”delivery, so packets may vanish
or be reordered during transport. Every participating computer is specified using aunique IP number.The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) , layered on top of IP , pro-
vides reliable connection-ordered transport. It permits telephone-like connections tobe established between computers and ensures that data is delivered reliably and inorder.
DNS Names
Because it is easier to remember names than numbers, the Domain Name Service (DNS) associates names
such as www.codesourcery.com with computers ’ unique IP numbers. DNS is implemented by a world-
wide hierarchy of name servers, but you don ’t need to understand DNS protocols to use Internet host
names in your programs.
Internet socket addresses contain two parts: a machine and a port number.This infor-mation is stored in a 
struct sockaddr_in variable. Set the sin_family field to AF_INET
to indicate that this is an Internet namespace address.The sin_addr field stores the
Internet address of the desired machine as a 32-bit integer IP number.A port number
distinguishes a given machine ’s different sockets. Because different machines store
multibyte values in different byte orders, use htons to convert the port number to 
network byte order . See the man page for ipfor more information.
T o convert human-readable hostnames, either numbers in standard dot notation
(such as 10.0.0.1) or DNS names (such as www.codesourcery.com ) into 32-bit IP 
numbers, you can use gethostbyname .This returns a pointer to the struct hostent
structure; the h_addr field contains the host ’s IP number. See the sample program in
Listing 5.12.
Listing 5.12 illustrates the use of Internet-domain sockets.The program obtains the
home page from the Web server whose hostname is specified on the command line.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 123
124 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication

void get_home_page (int socket_fd){
char buffer[10000];ssize_t number_characters_read;/* Send the HTTP GET command for the home page.  */sprintf (buffer, “GET /\n”);write (socket_fd, buffer, strlen (buffer));/* Read from the socket.  The call to read may notreturn all the data at one time, so keeptrying until we run out.  */while (1) {
number_characters_read = read (socket_fd, buffer, 10000);if (number_characters_read == 0)
return;
/* Write the data to standard output.  */fwrite (buffer, sizeof (char), number_characters_read, stdout);
}
}int main (int argc, char* const argv[]){
int socket_fd;struct sockaddr_in name;struct hostent* hostinfo;/* Create the socket.  */socket_fd = socket (PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);/* Store the server’s name in the socket address.  */name.sin_family = AF_INET;/* Convert from strings to numbers.  */hostinfo = gethostbyname (argv[1]);if (hostinfo == NULL)
return 1;
else
name.sin_addr = *((struct in_addr *) hostinfo->h_addr);
/* Web servers use port 80.  */name.sin_port = htons (80);06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 124
125 5.5 Sockets
/* Connect to the Web server  */if (connect (socket_fd, &name, sizeof (struct sockaddr_in)) == -1) {
perror (“connect”);return 1;
}/* Retrieve the server’s home page.  */get_home_page (socket_fd);return 0;
}
This program takes the hostname of the Web server on the command line (not aURL —that is, without the “http:// ”). It calls 
gethostbyname to translate the hostname
into a numerical IP address and then connects a stream (TCP) socket to port 80 onthat host.Web servers speak the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) , so the program
issues the HTTP 
GETcommand and the server responds by sending the text of the
home page.
Standard Port Numbers
By convention, Web servers listen for connections on port 80. Most Internet network services are associ-ated with a standard port number. For example, secure Web servers that use SSL listen for connectionson port 443, and mail servers (which speak SMTP) use port 25.On GNU/Linux systems, the associations between protocol/service names and standard port numbers arelisted in the file 
/etc/services . The first column is the protocol or service name. The second column
lists the port number and the connection type: tcp for connection-oriented, or udp for datagram.
If you implement custom network services using Internet-domain sockets, use port numbers greater than 1024.
For example, to retrieve the home page from the Web site www.codesourcery.com ,
invoke this:
% ./socket-inet www.codesourcery.com<html>
<meta http-equiv=”Content-Type” content=”text/html; charset=iso-8859-1”>
...
5.5.7 Socket Pairs
As we saw previously, the pipe function creates two file descriptors for the beginning
and end of a pipe. Pipes are limited because the file descriptors must be used byrelated processes and because communication is unidirectional.The 
socketpair func-
tion creates two file descriptors for two connected sockets on the same computer.These file descriptors permit two-way communication between related processes.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 125
126 Chapter 5 Interprocess Communication
Its first three parameters are the same as those of the socket call:They specify the
domain, connection style, and protocol.The last parameter is a two-integer array,which is filled with the file descriptions of the two sockets, similar to 
pipe.When you
call socketpair , you must specify PF_LOCAL as the domain.06 0430 CH05  5/22/01  10:23 AM  Page 126

L INUX,LIKE MOST OPERATING SYSTEMS ,INTERACTS WITH HARDWARE devices via
modularized software components called device drivers .A device driver hides the pecu-
liarities of a hardware device ’s communication protocols from the operating system
and allows the system to interact with the device through a standardized interface.
Under Linux, device drivers are part of the kernel and may be either linked stati-
cally into the kernel or loaded on demand as kernel modules. Device drivers run aspart of the kernel and aren ’t directly accessible to user processes. However, Linux pro-
vides a mechanism by which processes can communicate with a device driver —and
through it with a hardware device —via file-like objects.These objects appear in the
file system, and programs can open them, read from them, and write to them practi-cally as if they were normal files. Using either Linux ’s low-level I/O operations (see
Appendix B, “Low-Level I/O ”) or the standard C library ’s I/O operations, your pro-
grams can communicate with hardware devices through these file-like objects.
Linux also provides several file-like objects that communicate directly with the 
kernel rather than with device drivers.These aren ’t linked to hardware devices; instead,
they provide various kinds of specialized behavior that can be of use to application andsystem programs.08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  10:29 AM  Page 129
130 Chapter 6 Devices
Exercise Caution When Accessing Devices!
The techniques in this chapter provide direct access to device drivers running in the Linux kernel, andthrough them to hardware devices connected to the system. Use these techniques with care because mis-use can cause impair or damage the GNU/Linux system.See especially the sidebar “Dangers of Block Devices. ”  
6.1 Device Types
Device files aren ’t ordinary files —they do not represent regions of data on a disk-
based file system. Instead, data read from or written to a device file is communicatedto the corresponding device driver, and from there to the underlying device. Devicefiles come in two flavors:
nA character device represents a hardware device that reads or writes a serial stream
of data bytes. Serial and parallel ports, tape drives, terminal devices, and soundcards are examples of character devices.
nA block device represents a hardware device that reads or writes data in fixed-size
blocks. Unlike a character device, a block device provides random access to datastored on the device.A disk drive is an example of a block device.
T ypical application programs will never use block devices.While a disk drive is repre-sented as block devices, the contents of each disk partition typically contain a file sys-tem, and that file system is mounted into GNU/Linux ’s root file system tree. Only the
kernel code that implements the file system needs to access the block device directly;application programs access the disk ’s contents through normal files and directories.
Dangers of Block Devices
Block devices provide direct access to disk drive data. Although most GNU/Linux systems are configuredto prevent nonroot processes from accessing these devices directly, a root process can inflict severe dam-age by changing the contents of the disk. By writing to a disk block device, a program can modify ordestroy file system control information and even a disk ’s partition table and master boot record, thus
rendering a drive or even the entire system unusable. Always access these devices with great care.
Applications sometimes make use of character devices, though.We ’ll discuss several
of them in the following sections.
6.2 Device Numbers
Linux identifies devices using two numbers: the major device number and the minor device
number .The major device number specifies which driver the device corresponds to.
The correspondence from major device numbers to drivers is fixed and part of theLinux kernel sources. Note that the same major device number may correspond to08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  10:29 AM  Page 130
131 6.3 Device Entries
two different drivers, one a character device and one a block device. Minor devicenumbers distinguish individual devices or components controlled by a single driver.The meaning of a minor device number depends on the device driver.
For example, major device no. 3 corresponds to the primary IDE controller on the
system.An IDE controller can have two devices (disk, tape, or CD-ROM drives)attached to it; the “master ”device has minor device no. 0, and the “slave”device has
minor device no. 64. Individual partitions on the master device (if the device supportspartitions) are represented by minor device numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on. Individual parti-tions on the slave device are represented by minor device numbers 65, 66, 67, and so on.
Major device numbers are listed in the Linux kernel sources documentation.
On many GNU/Linux distributions, this documentation can be found in 
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt .The special entry /proc/devices lists
major device numbers corresponding to active device drivers currently loaded into thekernel. (See Chapter 7, “The 
/proc File System, ”for more information about /proc
file system entries.) 
6.3 Device Entries
A device entry is in many ways the same as a regular file.Y ou can move it using the mv
command and delete it using the rmcommand. If you try to copy a device entry using
cp, though, you ’ll read bytes from the device (if the device supports reading) and write
them to the destination file. If you try to overwrite a device entry, you ’ll write bytes to
the corresponding device instead.
Y ou can create a device entry in the file system using the mknod command (invoke
man 1 mknod for the man page) or the mknod system call (invoke man 2 mknod for the
man page). Creating a device entry in the file system doesn ’t automatically imply that
the corresponding device driver or hardware device is present or available; the deviceentry is merely a portal for communicating with the driver, if it ’s there. Only superuser
processes can create block and character devices using the 
mknod command or the
mknod system call.
T o create a device using the mknod command, specify as the first argument the path
at which the entry will appear in the file system. For the second argument, specify b
for a block device or cfor a character device. Provide the major and minor device
numbers as the third and fourth arguments, respectively. For example, this commandmakes a character device entry named 
lp0in the current directory.The device has
major device no. 6 and minor device no. 0.These numbers correspond to the first par-allel port on the Linux system.
% mknod ./lp0 c 6 008 0430 CH06  5/22/01  10:29 AM  Page 131
132 Chapter 6 Devices
Remember that only superuser processes can create block and character devices, soyou must be logged in as 
root to invoke this command successfully.
The lscommand displays device entries specially. If you invoke lswith the -lor 
-ooptions, the first character on each line of output specifies the type of the entry.
Recall that -(a hyphen) designates a normal file, while ddesignates a directory.
Similarly, bdesignates a block device, and cdesignates a character device. For the latter
two,lsprints the major and minor device numbers where it would the size of an
ordinary file. For example, we can display the block device that we just created:
% ls -l lp0crw-r-----    1 root     root       6,   0 Mar  7 17:03 lp0
In a program, you can determine whether a file system entry is a block or characterdevice and then retrieve its device numbers using 
stat. See Section B.2, “stat,”in
Appendix B, for instructions.
T o remove the entry, use rm.This doesn ’t remove the device or device driver; it
simply removes the device entry from the file system.
% rm ./lp0
6.3.1 The /devDirectory
By convention, a GNU/Linux system includes a directory /dev containing the full
complement of character and block device entries for devices that Linux knows about.Entries in 
/dev have standardized names corresponding to major and minor device
numbers.
For example, the master device attached to the primary IDE controller, which has
major and minor device numbers 3 and 0, has the standard name /dev/hda . If this
device supports partitions, the first partition on it, which has minor device no. 1, hasthe standard name 
/dev/hda1 .Y ou can check that this is true on your system:
% ls -l /dev/hda /dev/hda1brw-rw----    1 root     disk       3,   0 May  5  1998 /dev/hdabrw-rw----    1 root     disk       3,   1 May  5  1998 /dev/hda1
Similarly, /dev has an entry for the parallel port character device that we used 
previously:
% ls -l /dev/lp0crw-rw----    1 root     daemon     6,   0 May  5  1998 /dev/lp0
In most cases, you should not use mknod to create your own device entries. Use the
entries in /dev instead. Non-superuser programs have no choice but to use preexisting
device entries because they cannot create their own.T ypically, only system administra-tors and developers working with specialized hardware devices will need to createdevice entries. Most GNU/Linux distributions include facilities to help system administrators create standard device entries with the correct names.08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  10:29 AM  Page 132
133 6.4 Hardware Devices
6.3.2 Accessing Devices by Opening Files
How do you use these devices? In the case of character devices, it can be quite simple:Open the device as if it were a normal file, and read from or write to it.Y ou can evenuse normal file commands such as 
cat, or your shell ’s redirection syntax, to send data
to or from the device.
For example, if you have a printer connected to your computer ’s first parallel port,
you can print files by sending them directly to /dev/lp0 .1T o print the contents of
document.txt , invoke the following:
% cat document.txt > /dev/lp0
Y ou must have permission to write to the device entry for this to succeed; on manyGNU/Linux systems, the permissions are set so that only 
root and the system ’s printer
daemon ( lpd) can write to the file.Also, what comes out of your printer depends on
how your printer interprets the contents of the data you send it. Some printers willprint plain text files that are sent to them,
2while others will not. PostScript printers
will render and print PostScript files that you send to them.
In a program, sending data to a device is just as simple. For example, this code frag-
ment uses low-level I/O functions to send the contents of a buffer to /dev/lp0 .
int fd = open (“/dev/lp0”, O_WRONLY);write (fd, buffer, buffer_length);close (fd);
6.4 Hardware Devices
Some common block devices are listed in Table 6.1. Device numbers for similardevices follow the obvious pattern (for instance, the second partition on the first SCSIdrive is 
/dev/sda2 ). It’s occasionally useful to know which devices these device names
correspond to when examining mounted file systems in /proc/mounts (see Section
7.5,“Drives, Mounts, and File Systems, ”in Chapter 7, for more about this).

Y ou can access certain hardware components through more than one character device;often, the different character devices provide different semantics. For example, whenyou use the IDE tape device 
/dev/ht0 , Linux automatically rewinds the tape in the
drive when you close the file descriptor.Y ou can use the device /dev/nht0 to access
the same tape drive, except that Linux will not automatically rewind the tape whenyou close the file descriptor.Y ou sometimes might see programs using 
/dev/cua0 and
similar devices; these are older interfaces to serial ports such as /dev/ttyS0 .Table 6.1 Continued

135 6.4 Hardware Devices
Occasionally, you ’ll want to write data directly to character devices —for example:
nA terminal program might access a modem directly through a serial port device.Data written to or read from the devices is transmitted via the modem to aremote computer.
nA tape backup program might write data directly to a tape device.The backupprogram could implement its own compression and error-checking format.
nA program can write directly to the first virtual terminal3writing data to
/dev/tty1 .
T erminal windows running in a graphical environment, or remote login terminalsessions, are not associated with virtual terminals; instead, they ’re associated with
pseudo-terminals. See Section 6.6, “PTYs, ”for information about these.
nSometimes a program needs to access the terminal device with which it is associated.For example, your program may need to prompt the user for a password. Forsecurity reasons, you might want to ignore redirection of standard input andoutput and always read the password from the terminal, no matter how the userinvokes the command. One way to do this is to open 
/dev/tty , which always
corresponds to the terminal device associated with the process that opens it.Write the prompt message to that device, and read the password from it. Byignoring standard input and output, this prevents the user from feeding yourprogram a password from a file using shell syntax such as this:
% secure_program < my-password.txt
If you need to authenticate users in your program, you should learn aboutGNU/Linux ’s PAM facility. See Section 10.5, “Authenticating Users, ”in
Chapter 10, “Security, ”for more information.
nA program can play sounds through the system ’s sound card by sending audio
data to /dev/audio . Note that the audio data must be in Sun audio format (usu-
ally associated with the .auextension).
For example, many GNU/Linux distributions come with the classic sound file
/usr/share/sndconfig/sample.au . If your system includes this file, try playing it
by invoking the following:
% cat /usr/share/sndconfig/sample.au > /dev/audio
If you ’re planning on using sound in your program, though, you should investi-
gate the various sound libraries and services available for GNU/Linux.TheGnome windowing environment uses the Enlightenment Sound Daemon(EsounD), at 
http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/EsounD.html . KDE uses aRts, at
http://space.twc.de/~stefan/kde/arts-mcop-doc/ . If you use one of these
sound systems instead of writing directly to /dev/audio , your program will
cooperate better with other programs that use the computer ’s sound card.
3. On most GNU/Linux systems, you can switch to the first virtual terminal by pressing
Ctrl+Alt+F1. Use Ctrl+Alt+F2 for the second virtual terminal, and so on.08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  10:29 AM  Page 135

6.5 Special Devices
Linux also provides several character devices that don ’t correspond to hardware
devices.These entries all use the major device no. 1, which is associated with theLinux kernel ’s memory device instead of a device driver.
6.5.1 /dev/null
The entry /dev/null , thenull device , is very handy. It serves two purposes; you are
probably familiar at least with the first one:
nLinux discards any data written to /dev/null .A common trick is to specify
/dev/null as an output file in some context where the output is unwanted.
For example, to run a command and discard its standard output (without print-ing it or writing it to a file), redirect standard output to 
/dev/null :
% verbose_command > /dev/null
nReading from /dev/null always results in an end-of-file. For instance, if you
open a file descriptor to /dev/null using open and then attempt to read from
the file descriptor, read will read no bytes and will return 0. If you copy from
/dev/null to another file, the destination will be a zero-length file:
% cp /dev/null empty-file% ls -l empty-file-rw-rw----    1 samuel   samuel          0 Mar  8 00:27 empty-file
6.5.2 /dev/zero
The device entry /dev/zero behaves as if it were an infinitely long file filled with 0
bytes.As much data as you ’d try to read from /dev/zero , Linux “generates ”enough 0
bytes.
T o illustrate this, let ’s run the hex dump program presented in Listing B.4 in
Section B.1.4, “Reading Data, ”of Appendix B.This program prints the contents of a
file in hexadecimal form.
% ./hexdump /dev/zero0x000000 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x000010 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x000020 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x000030 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ...
Hit Ctrl+C when you ’re convinced that it will go on indefinitely.
Memory mapping /dev/zero is an advanced technique for allocating memory. See
Section 5.3.5, “Other Uses for mmap,”in Chapter 5, “Interprocess Communication, ”for
more information, and see the sidebar “Obtaining Page-Aligned Memory ”in Section
8.9,“mprotect : Setting Memory Permissions, ”in Chapter 8, “Linux System Calls, ”for
an example.08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  10:29 AM  Page 136
137 6.5 Special Devices
6.5.3 /dev/full
The entry /dev/full behaves as if it were a file on a file system that has no more
room.A write to /dev/full fails and sets errno to ENOSPC , which ordinarily indicates
that the written-to device is full.
For example, you can try to write to /dev/full using the cpcommand:
% cp /etc/fstab /dev/fullcp: /dev/full: No space left on device
The /dev/full entry is primarily useful to test how your program behaves if it runs
out of disk space while writing to a file.
6.5.4 Random Number Devices
The special devices /dev/random and /dev/urandom provide access to the Linux ker-
nel’s built-in random number –generation facility.
Most software functions for generating random numbers, such as the rand function
in the standard C library, actually generate pseudorandom numbers. Although these
numbers satisfy some properties of random numbers, they are reproducible: If you startwith the same seed value, you ’ll obtain the same sequence of pseudorandom numbers
every time.This behavior is inevitable because computers are intrinsically deterministicand predictable. For certain applications, though, this behavior is undesirable; forinstance, it is sometimes possible to break a cryptographic algorithm if you can obtainthe sequence of random numbers that it employs.
T o obtain better random numbers in computer programs requires an external
source of randomness.The Linux kernel harnesses a particularly good source of randomness: you!By measuring the time delay between your input actions, such as
keystrokes and mouse movements, Linux is capable of generating an unpredictablestream of high-quality random numbers.Y ou can access this stream by reading from
/dev/random and /dev/urandom .The data that you read is a stream of randomly 
generated bytes.
The difference between the two devices exhibits itself when Linux exhausts its
store of randomness. If you try to read a large number of bytes from /dev/random but
don’t generate any input actions (you don ’t type, move the mouse, or perform a similar
action), Linux blocks the read operation. Only when you provide some randomnessdoes Linux generate some more random bytes and return them to your program.
For example, try displaying the contents of 
/dev/random using the odcommand.4
Each row of output shows 16 random bytes.
4.We use odhere instead of the hexdump program presented in Listing B.4, even though they
do pretty much the same thing, because hexdump terminates when it runs out of data, while od
waits for more data to become available.The -t x1 option tells odto print file contents in
hexadecimal.08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  10:29 AM  Page 137
138 Chapter 6 Devices
% od -t x1 /dev/random 0000000 2c 9c 7a db 2e 79 3d 65 36 c2 e3 1b 52 75 1e 1a0000020 d3 6d 1e a7 91 05 2d 4d c3 a6 de 54 29 f4 46 040000040 b3 b0 8d 94 21 57 f3 90 61 dd 26 ac 94 c3 b9 3a0000060 05 a3 02 cb 22 0a bc c9 45 dd a6 59 40 22 53 d4
The number of lines of output that you see will vary —there may be quite a few —but
the output will eventually pause when Linux exhausts its store of randomness. Nowtry moving your mouse or typing on the keyboard, and watch additional randomnumbers appear. For even better randomness, let your cat walk on the keyboard.
A read from 
/dev/urandom , in contrast, will never block. If Linux runs out of ran-
domness, it uses a cryptographic algorithm to generate pseudorandom bytes from thepast sequence of random bytes.Although these bytes are random enough for manypurposes, they don ’t pass as many tests of randomness as those obtained from
/dev/random .
For instance, if you invoke the following, the random bytes will fly by forever, until
you kill the program with Ctrl+C:
% od -t x1 /dev/urandom0000000 62 71 d6 3e af dd de 62 c0 42 78 bd 29 9c 69 490000020 26 3b 95 bc b9 6c 15 16 38 fd 7e 34 f0 ba ce c30000040 95 31 e5 2c 8d 8a dd f4 c4 3b 9b 44 2f 20 d1 54...
Using random numbers from /dev/random in a program is easy, too. Listing 6.1 
presents a function that generates a random number using bytes read from in
/dev/random . Remember that /dev/random blocks a read until there is enough ran-
domness available to satisfy it; you can use /dev/urandom instead if fast execution is
more important and you can live with the potential lower quality of random numbers.

}
6.5.5 Loopback Devices
A loopback device enables you to simulate a block device using an ordinary disk file.
Imagine a disk drive device for which data is written to and read from a file named
disk-image rather than to and from the tracks and sectors of an actual physical disk
drive or disk partition. (Of course, the file disk-image must reside on an actual disk,
which must be larger than the simulated disk.) A loopback device enables you to use afile in this manner.
Loopback devices are named 
/dev/loop0 ,/dev/loop1 , and so on. Each can be used
to simulate a single block device at one time. Note that only the superuser can set upa loopback device.
A loopback device can be used in the same way as any other block device. In 
particular, you can construct a file system on the device and then mount that file sys-tem as you would mount the file system on an ordinary disk or partition. Such a filesystem, which resides in its entirety within an ordinary disk file, is called a virtual file
system .08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  10:29 AM  Page 139
140 Chapter 6 Devices
T o construct a virtual file system and mount it with a loopback device, follow 
these steps:
1. Create an empty file to hold the virtual file system.The size of the file will be
the apparent size of the loopback device after it is mounted.
One convenient way to construct a file of a fixed size is with the ddcommand.
This command copies blocks (by default, 512 bytes each) from one file toanother.The 
/dev/zero file is a convenient source of bytes to copy from.
T o construct a 10MB file named disk-image , invoke the following:
% dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/disk-image count=20480
20480+0 records in20480+0 records out% ls -l /tmp/disk-image
-rw-rw----     1 root     root     10485760 Mar  8 01:56 /tmp/disk-image
2. The file that you’ve just created is filled with 0 bytes. Before you mount it, you
must construct a file system.This sets up the various control structures needed toorganize and store files, and builds the root directory.
Y ou can build any type of file system you like in your disk image.T o construct
an 
ext2 file system (the type most commonly used for Linux disks), use the
mke2fs command. Because it’s usually run on a block device, not an ordinary
file, it asks for confirmation:
% mke2fs -q /tmp/disk-image
mke2fs 1.18, 11-Nov-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09disk-image is not a block special device.Proceed anyway? (y,n) y
The -qoption suppresses summary information about the newly created file 
system. Leave this option out if you’re curious about it.
Now disk-image contains a brand-new file system, as if it were a freshly 
initialized 10MB disk drive.08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  2:37 PM  Page 140
141 6.5 Special Devices
3. Mount the file system using a loopback device.T o do this, use the mount
command, specifying the disk image file as the mount device.Also specify
loop=loopback-device as a mount option, using the -ooption to mount to tell
mount which loopback device to use.
For example, to mount our disk-image file system, invoke these commands.
Remember, only the superuser may use a loopback device.The first commandcreates a directory,
/tmp/virtual-fs , to use as the mount point for the virtual
file system.
% mkdir /tmp/virtual-fs
% mount -o loop=/dev/loop0 /tmp/disk-image /tmp/virtual-fs
Now your disk image is mounted as if it were an ordinary 10MB disk drive.
% df -h /tmp/virtual-fsFilesystem             Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/tmp/disk-image        9.7M   13k  9.2M    0% /tmp/virtual-fs
Y ou can use it like any other disk:
% cd /tmp/virtual-fs
% echo ‘Hello, world!’ > test.txt% ls -l total 13drwxr-xr-x     2 root     root        12288 Mar  8 02:00 lost+found
-rw-rw----     1 root     root           14 Mar  8 02:12 test.txt
% cat test.txt Hello, world!
Note that lost+found is a directory that was automatically added by mke2fs .5
5. If the file system is ever damaged, and some data is recovered but not associated with a
file, it is placed in lost+found .08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  2:37 PM  Page 141
142 Chapter 6 Devices
When you’re done, unmount the virtual file system.
% cd /tmp
% umount /tmp/virtual-fs
Y ou can delete disk-image if you like, or you can mount it later to access the
files on the virtual file system.Y ou can also copy it to another computer andmount it there—the whole file system that you created on it will be intact.
Instead of creating a file system from scratch, you can copy one directly from a device.
For instance, you can create an image of the contents of a CD-ROM simply by copying it from the CD-ROM device.
If you have an IDE CD-ROM drive, use the corresponding device name, such as
/dev/hda , described previously. If you have a SCSI CD-ROM drive, the device name
will be /dev/scd0 or similar.Y our system may also have a symbolic link /dev/cdrom
that points to the appropriate device. Consult your /etc/fstab file to determine what
device corresponds to your computer’s CD-ROM drive.
Simply copy that device to a file.The resulting file will be a complete disk image of
the file system on the CD-ROM in the drive—for example:
% cp /dev/cdrom /tmp/cdrom-image
This may take several minutes, depending on the CD-ROM you’re copying and thespeed of your drive.The resulting image file will be quite large—as large as the con-tents of the CD-ROM.
Now you can mount this CD-ROM image without having the original CD-ROM
in the drive. For example, to mount it on 
/mnt/cdrom , use this line:
% mount -o loop=/dev/loop0 /tmp/cdrom-image /mnt/cdrom
Because the image is on a hard disk drive, it’ll perform much faster than the actualCD-ROM disk. Note that most CD-ROMs use the file system type 
iso9660 .
6.6 PTYs
If you run the mount command with no command-line arguments, which displays 
the file systems mounted on your system, you’ll notice a line that looks something like this:
none on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
This indicates that a special type of file system, devpts , is mounted at /dev/pts .This
file system, which isn’t associated with any hardware device, is a “magic” file systemthat is created by the Linux kernel. It’s similar to the 
/proc file system; see Chapter 7
for more information about how this works.08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  2:37 PM  Page 142
143 6.6 PTYs
Like the /dev directory, /dev/pts contains entries corresponding to devices. But
unlike /dev, which is an ordinary directory, /dev/pts is a special directory that is cre-
ated dynamically by the Linux kernel.The contents of the directory vary with timeand reflect the state of the running system.
The entries in 
/dev/pts correspond to pseudo-terminals (or pseudo-TTYs , or PTYs ).
Linux creates a PTY for every new terminal window you open and displays a corre-sponding entry in 
/dev/pts .The PTY device acts like a terminal device —it accepts
input from the keyboard and displays text output from the programs that run in it.PTYs are numbered, and the PTY number is the name of the corresponding entry in
/dev/pts .
Y ou can display the terminal device associated with a process using the pscom-
mand. Specify ttyas one of the fields of a custom format with the -ooption.T o dis-
play the process ID,TTY , and command line of each process sharing the sameterminal, invoke 
ps -o pid,tty,cmd .
6.6.1 A PTY Demonstration
For example, you can determine the PTY associated with a given terminal window byinvoking in the window this command:
% ps -o pid,tty,cmd
PID TT       CMD
28832 pts/4    bash29287 pts/4    ps -o pid,tty,cmd
This particular terminal window is running in PTY 4.
The PTY has a corresponding entry in /dev/pts :
% ls -l /dev/pts/4crw--w----    1 samuel   tty      136,   4 Mar  8 02:56 /dev/pts/4
Note that it is a character device, and its owner is the owner of the process for whichit was created.
Y ou can read from or write to the PTY device. If you read from it, you ’ll hijack
keyboard input that would otherwise be sent to the program running in the PTY . Ifyou write to it, the data will appear in that window.
Try opening a new terminal window, and determine its PTY number by invoking
ps -o pid,tty,cmd . From another window, write some text to the PTY device. For
example, if the new terminal window ’s PTY number is 7, invoke this command from
another window:
% echo ‘Hello, other window!’ > /dev/pts/7
The output appears in the new terminal window. If you close the new terminal win-dow, the entry 
7in /dev/pts disappears.08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  10:29 AM  Page 143
144 Chapter 6 Devices
If you invoke psto determine the TTY from a text-mode virtual terminal (press
Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to the first virtual terminal, for instance), you ’ll see that it ’s
running in an ordinary terminal device instead of a PTY:
% ps -o pid,tty,cmd
PID TT       CMD
29325 tty1     -bash29353 tty1     ps -o pid,tty,cmd
6.7 ioctl
The ioctl system call is an all-purpose interface for controlling hardware devices.The
first argument to ioctl is a file descriptor, which should be opened to the device that
you want to control.The second argument is a request code that indicates the opera-tion that you want to perform.Various request codes are available for different devices.Depending on the request code, there may be additional arguments supplying data to 
ioctl .
Many of the available requests codes for various devices are listed in the ioctl_list
man page. Using ioctl generally requires a detailed understanding of the device driver
corresponding to the hardware device that you want to control. Most of these arequite specialized and are beyond the scope of this book. However, we ’ll present one
example to give you a taste of how 
ioctl is used.
Listing 6.2 (cdrom-eject.c ) Eject a CD-ROM
#include <fcntl.h>#include <linux/cdrom.h>#include <sys/ioctl.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
/* Open a file descriptor to the device specified on the command line.  */int fd = open (argv[1], O_RDONLY);/* Eject the CD-ROM.  */ioctl (fd, CDROMEJECT);/* Close the file descriptor.  */close (fd);return 0;
}08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  10:29 AM  Page 144
145 6.7 ioctl
Listing 6.2 presents a short program that ejects the disk in a CD-ROM drive (if thedrive supports this). It takes a single command-line argument, the CD-ROM drivedevice. It opens a file descriptor to the device and invokes 
ioctl with the request
code CDROMEJECT .This request, defined in the header <linux/cdrom.h> , instructs the
device to eject the disk.
For example, if your system has an IDE CD-ROM drive connected as the master
device on the secondary IDE controller, the corresponding device is /dev/hdc .T o eject
the disk from the drive, invoke this line:
% ./cdrom-eject /dev/hdc08 0430 CH06  5/22/01  10:29 AM  Page 145

The /procFile System
7
TRY INVOKING THE mount COMMAND WITHOUT ARGUMENTS —this displays the file
systems currently mounted on your GNU/Linux computer.Y ou ’ll see one line that
looks like this:
none on /proc type proc (rw)
This is the special /proc file system . Notice that the first field, none, indicates that this
file system isn ’t associated with a hardware device such as a disk drive. Instead, /proc
is a window into the running Linux kernel. Files in the /proc file system don ’t corre-
spond to actual files on a physical device. Instead, they are magic objects that behavelike files but provide access to parameters, data structures, and statistics in the kernel.The “contents ”of these files are not always fixed blocks of data, as ordinary file con-
tents are. Instead, they are generated on the fly by the Linux kernel when you readfrom the file.Y ou can also change the configuration of the running kernel by writingto certain files in the 
/proc file system.
Let’s look at an example:
% ls -l /proc/version-r--r--r--    1 root     root            0 Jan 17 18:09 /proc/version
Note that the file size is zero; because the file ’s contents are generated by the kernel,
the concept of file size is not applicable.Also, if you try this command yourself, you ’ll
notice that the modification time on the file is the current time.09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 147
148 Chapter 7 The /proc File System
What ’s in this file? The contents of /proc/version consist of a string describing the
Linux kernel version number. It contains the version information that would beobtained by the 
uname system call, described in Chapter 8, “Linux System Calls, ”in
Section 8.15, “uname ,”plus additional information such as the version of the compiler
that was used to compile the kernel.Y ou can read from /proc/version like you would
any other file. For instance, an easy way to display its contents is with the catcommand.
% cat /proc/versionLinux version 2.2.14-5.0 (root@porky.devel.redhat.com) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #1 Tue Mar 7 21:07:39 EST 2000
The various entries in the /proc file system are described extensively in the proc man
page (Section 5).T o view it, invoke this command:
% man 5 proc
In this chapter, we ’ll describe some of the features of the /proc file system that are
most likely to be useful to application programmers, and we ’ll give examples of using
them. Some of the features of /proc are handy for debugging, too.
If you ’re interested in exactly how /proc works, take a look at the source code in
the Linux kernel sources, under /usr/src/linux/fs/proc/ .
7.1 Extracting Information from /proc
Most of the entries in /proc provide information formatted to be readable by humans,
but the formats are simple enough to be easily parsed. For example, /proc/cpuinfo
contains information about the system CPU (or CPUs, for a multiprocessor machine).The output is a table of values, one per line, with a description of the value and acolon preceding each value.
For example, the output might look like this:
% cat /proc/cpuinfoprocessor       : 0vendor_id       : GenuineIntelcpu family      : 6model           : 5model name      : Pentium II (Deschutes)stepping        : 2cpu MHz         : 400.913520cache size      : 512 KBfdiv_bug        : nohlt_bug         : nosep_bug         : nof00f_bug        : nocoma_bug        : nofpu             : yesfpu_exception   : yescpuid level     : 2wp              : yesflags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 mmx fxsrbogomips        : 399.7709 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 148
149 7.1 Extracting Information from /proc
We’ll describe the interpretation of some of these fields in Section 7.3.1, “CPU
Information. ”
A simple way to extract a value from this output is to read the file into a buffer and
parse it in memory using sscanf . Listing 7.1 shows an example of this.The program
includes the function get_cpu_clock_speed that reads from /proc/cpuinfo into 
memory and extracts the first CPU ’s clock speed.
Listing 7.1 (clock-speed.c ) Extract CPU Clock Speed from /proc/cpuinfo
#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>/* Returns the clock speed of the system’s CPU in MHz, as reported by
/proc/cpuinfo.  On a multiprocessor machine, returns the speed ofthe first CPU.  On error returns zero.  */
float get_cpu_clock_speed (){
FILE* fp;char buffer[1024];size_t bytes_read;char* match;float clock_speed;/* Read the entire contents of /proc/cpuinfo into the buffer.  */fp = fopen (“/proc/cpuinfo”, “r”);bytes_read = fread (buffer, 1, sizeof (buffer), fp);fclose (fp);/* Bail if read failed or if buffer isn’t big enough.  */if (bytes_read == 0 
||bytes_read == sizeof (buffer))
return 0;
/* NUL-terminate the text.  */buffer[bytes_read] = ‘\0’;/* Locate the line that starts with “cpu MHz”.  */match = strstr (buffer, “cpu MHz”);if (match == NULL)
return 0;
/* Parse the line to extract the clock speed.  */sscanf (match, “cpu MHz : %f”, &clock_speed);return clock_speed;
}int main (){
printf (“CPU clock speed: %4.0f MHz\n”, get_cpu_clock_speed ());return 0;

150 Chapter 7 The /proc File System
Be aware, however, that the names, semantics, and output formats of entries in the
/proc file system might change in new Linux kernel revisions. If you use them in a
program, you should make sure that the program ’s behavior degrades gracefully if the
/proc entry is missing or is formatted unexpectedly.
7.2 Process Entries
The /proc file system contains a directory entry for each process running on the
GNU/Linux system.The name of each directory is the process ID of the correspond-ing process.
1These directories appear and disappear dynamically as processes start and
terminate on the system. Each directory contains several entries providing access toinformation about the running process. From these process directories the 
/proc file
system gets its name.
Each process directory contains these entries:
ncmdline contains the argument list for the process.The cmdline entry is
described in Section 7.2.2, “Process Argument List. ”
ncwdis a symbolic link that points to the current working directory of the process
(as set, for instance, with the chdir call).
nenviron contains the process ’s environment.The environ entry is described in
Section 7.2.3, “Process Environment. ”
nexeis a symbolic link that points to the executable image running in the
process.The exeentry is described in Section 7.2.4, “Process Executable. ”
nfdis a subdirectory that contains entries for the file descriptors opened by the
process.These are described in Section 7.2.5, “Process File Descriptors. ”
nmaps displays information about files mapped into the process ’s address. See
Chapter 5, “Interprocess Communication, ”Section 5.3, “Mapped Memory, ”for
details of how memory-mapped files work. For each mapped file, maps displays
the range of addresses in the process ’s address space into which the file is
mapped, the permissions on these addresses, the name of the file, and otherinformation.The 
maps table for each process displays the executable running in the process,
any loaded shared libraries, and other files that the process has mapped in.
nroot is a symbolic link to the root directory for this process. Usually, this is a
symbolic link to /, the system root directory.The root directory for a process
can be changed using the chroot call or the chroot command.2
1. On some UNIX systems, the process IDs are padded with zeros. On GNU/Linux, they 
are not.
2.The chroot call and command are outside the scope of this book. See the chroot man page
in Section 1 for information about the command (invoke man 1 chroot ), or the chroot man
page in Section 2 (invoke man 2 chroot ) for information about the call.09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 150
151 7.2 Process Entries
nstat contains lots of status and statistical information about the process.These
are the same data as presented in the status entry, but in raw numerical format,
all on a single line.The format is difficult to read but might be more suitable forparsing by programs.If you want to use the 
stat entry in your programs, see the proc man page,
which describes its contents, by invoking man 5 proc .
nstatm contains information about the memory used by the process.The statm
entry is described in Section 7.2.6, “Process Memory Statistics. ”
nstatus contains lots of status and statistical information about the process,
formatted to be comprehensible by humans. Section 7.2.7, “Process Statistics, ”
contains a description of the status entry.
nThe cpuentry appears only on SMP Linux kernels. It contains a breakdown of
process time (user and system) by CPU.
Note that for security reasons, the permissions of some entries are set so that only theuser who owns the process (or the superuser) can access them.
7.2.1 /proc/self
One additional entry in the /proc file system makes it easy for a program to use /proc
to find information about its own process.The entry /proc/self is a symbolic link to
the /proc directory corresponding to the current process.The destination of the
/proc/self link depends on which process looks at it: Each process sees its own
process directory as the target of the link.
For example, the program in Listing 7.2 reads the target of the /proc/self link to
determine its process ID. (We ’re doing it this way for illustrative purposes only; calling
the getpid function, described in Chapter 3, “Processes, ”in Section 3.1.1, “Process
IDs,”is a much easier way to do the same thing.) This program uses the readlink sys-
tem call, described in Section 8.11, “readlink : Reading Symbolic Links, ”to extract
the target of the symbolic link.
Listing 7.2 (get-pid.c ) Obtain the Process ID from /proc/self
#include <stdio.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>/* Returns the process ID of the calling processes, as determined from
the /proc/self symlink.  */
pid_t get_pid_from_proc_self (){
char target[32];int pid;/* Read the target of the symbolic link.  */readlink (“/proc/self”, target, sizeof (target));
continues09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 151
152 Chapter 7 The /proc File System
/* The target is a directory named for the process ID.  */sscanf (target, “%d”, &pid);return (pid_t) pid;
}int main (){
printf (“/proc/self reports process id %d\n”, 
(int) get_pid_from_proc_self ());
printf (“getpid() reports process id %d\n”, (int) getpid ());return 0;
}
7.2.2 Process Argument List
The cmdline entry contains the process argument list (see Chapter 2, “Writing Good
GNU/Linux Software, ”Section 2.1.1, “The Argument List ”).The arguments are pre-
sented as a single character string, with arguments separated by NULs. Most string func-tions expect that the entire character string is terminated with a single NUL and will nothandle NULs embedded within strings, so you ’ll have to handle the contents specially.
NUL vs. NULL
NUL is the character with integer value 0. It ’s different from NULL, which is a pointer with value 0.
In C, a character string is usually terminated with a NUL character. For instance, the character string
“Hello, world!” occupies 14 bytes because there is an implicit NUL after the exclamation point
indicating the end of the string. NULL, on the other hand, is a pointer value that you can be sure will never correspond to a real memoryaddress in your program.In C and C++, NUL is expressed as the character constant 
‘\0’ , or (char) 0 . The definition of NULL
differs among operating systems; on Linux, it is defined as ((void*)0) in C and simply 0in C++.
In Section 2.1.1, we presented a program in Listing 2.1 that printed out its own argu-ment list. Using the 
cmdline entries in the /proc file system, we can implement a pro-
gram that prints the argument of another process. Listing 7.3 is such a program; itprints the argument list of the process with the specified process ID. Because theremay be several NULs in the contents of 
cmdline rather than a single one at the end,
we can ’t determine the length of the string with strlen (which simply counts the
number of characters until it encounters a NUL). Instead, we determine the length of
cmdline from read, which returns the number of bytes that were read.Listing 7.2 Continued09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 152

Arguments are separated by NULs. */next_arg = arg_list;while (next_arg < arg_list + length) {
/* Print the argument.  Each is NUL-terminated, so just treat it
like an ordinary string.  */
printf (“%s\n”, next_arg);/* Advance to the next argument.  Since each argument is
NUL-terminated, strlen counts the length of the next argument,not the entire argument list.  */
next_arg += strlen (next_arg) + 1;
}

pid_t pid = (pid_t) atoi (argv[1]);print_process_arg_list (pid);return 0;
}09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 153
154 Chapter 7 The /proc File System
For example, suppose that process 372 is the system logger daemon, syslogd .
% ps 372
PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND372 ?        S      0:00 syslogd -m 0
% ./print-arg-list 372syslogd-m0
In this case, syslogd was invoked with the arguments -m 0.
7.2.3 Process Environment
The environ entry contains a process ’s environment (see Section 2.1.6, “The
Environment ”).As with cmdline , the individual environment variables are separated by
NULs.The format of each element is the same as that used in the environ variable,
namely VARIABLE =value .
Listing 7.4 presents a generalization of the program in Listing 2.3 in Section 2.1.6.
This version takes a process ID number on its command line and prints the environ-ment for that process by reading it from 
/proc .
Listing 7.4 (print-environment.c ) Display the Environment of a Process
#include <fcntl.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>/* Prints the environment, one environment variable to a line, of the
process given by PID.  */
void print_process_environment (pid_t pid){
int fd;char filename[24];char environment[8192];size_t length;char* next_var;/* Generate the name of the environ file for the process. */snprintf (filename, sizeof (filename), “/proc/%d/environ”, (int) pid);/* Read the contents of the file. */fd = open (filename, O_RDONLY);length = read (fd, environment, sizeof (environment));close (fd);/* read does not NUL-terminate the buffer, so do it here. */environment[length] = ‘\0’;09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 154
155 7.2 Process Entries
/* Loop over variables.  Variables are separated by NULs. */next_var = environment;while (next_var < environment + length) {
/* Print the variable.  Each is NUL-terminated, so just treat it
like an ordinary string.  */
printf (“%s\n”, next_var);/* Advance to the next variable.  Since each variable is
NUL-terminated, strlen counts the length of the next variable,not the entire variable list.  */
next_var += strlen (next_var) + 1;
}
}int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
pid_t pid = (pid_t) atoi (argv[1]);print_process_environment (pid);return 0;
}
7.2.4 Process Executable
The exeentry points to the executable file being run in a process. In Section 2.1.1,
we explained that typically the program executable name is passed as the first elementof the argument list. Note, though, that this is purely conventional; a program may beinvoked with any argument list. Using the 
exeentry in the /proc file system is a more
reliable way to determine which executable is running.
One useful technique is to extract the path containing the executable from the
/proc file system. For many programs, auxiliary files are installed in directories with
known paths relative to the main program executable, so it ’s necessary to determine
where that executable actually is.The function get_executable_path in Listing 7.5
determines the path of the executable running in the calling process by examining thesymbolic link 
/proc/self/exe .
Listing 7.5 (get-exe-path.c ) Get the Path of the Currently Running Program
Executable
#include <limits.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>#include <unistd.h>/* Finds the path containing the currently running program executable.
The path is placed into BUFFER, which is of length LEN.  Returnsthe number of characters in the path, or -1 on error.  */

size_t get_executable_path (char* buffer, size_t len){
char* path_end;/* Read the target of /proc/self/exe.  */if (readlink (“/proc/self/exe”, buffer, len) <= 0)
return -1;
/* Find the last occurrence of a forward slash, the path separator.  */path_end = strrchr (buffer, ‘/’);if (path_end == NULL)
return -1;
/* Advance to the character past the last slash.  */++path_end;/* Obtain the directory containing the program by truncating the
path after the last slash.  */
*path_end = ‘\0’;/* The length of the path is the number of characters up through the
last slash.  */
return (size_t) (path_end - buffer);
}int main (){
char path[PATH_MAX];get_executable_path (path, sizeof (path));printf (“this program is in the directory %s\n”, path);return 0;
}
7.2.5 Process File Descriptors
The fdentry is a subdirectory that contains entries for the file descriptors opened by a
process. Each entry is a symbolic link to the file or device opened on that file descrip-tor.Y ou can write to or read from these symbolic links; this writes to or reads from thecorresponding file or device opened in the target process.The entries in the 
fdsubdi-
rectory are named by the file descriptor numbers.
Here’s a neat trick you can try with fdentries in /proc . Open a new window, and
find the process ID of the shell process by running ps.
% ps
PID TTY          TIME CMD
1261 pts/4    00:00:00 bash2455 pts/4    00:00:00 psListing 7.5 Continued09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 156
157 7.2 Process Entries
In this case, the shell ( bash) is running in process 1261. Now open a second window,
and look at the contents of the fd subdirectory for that process.
% ls -l /proc/1261/fdtotal 0lrwx------    1 samuel   samuel         64 Jan 30 01:02 0 -> /dev/pts/4lrwx------    1 samuel   samuel         64 Jan 30 01:02 1 -> /dev/pts/4lrwx------    1 samuel   samuel         64 Jan 30 01:02 2 -> /dev/pts/4
(There may be other lines of output corresponding to other open file descriptors aswell.) Recall that we mentioned in Section 2.1.4, “Standard I/O, ”that file descriptors
0, 1, and 2 are initialized to standard input, output, and error, respectively.Thus, bywriting to 
/proc/1261/fd/1 , you can write to the device attached to stdout for the
shell process —in this case, the pseudo TTY in the first window. In the second win-
dow, try writing a message to that file:
% echo “Hello, world.” >> /proc/1261/fd/1
The text appears in the first window.
File descriptors besides standard input, output, and error appear in the fdsubdirec-
tory, too. Listing 7.6 presents a program that simply opens a file descriptor to a filespecified on the command line and then loops forever.
Listing 7.6 (open-and-spin.c ) Open a File for Reading
#include <fcntl.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
const char* const filename = argv[1];int fd = open (filename, O_RDONLY);printf (“in process %d, file descriptor %d is open to %s\n”, 
(int) getpid (), (int) fd, filename);
while (1);return 0;
}
Try running it in one window:
%  ./open-and-spin /etc/fstabin process 2570, file descriptor 3 is open to /etc/fstab
In another window, take a look at the fdsubdirectory corresponding to this process in
/proc .
% ls -l /proc/2570/fdtotal 0lrwx------    1 samuel   samuel         64 Jan 30 01:30 0 -> /dev/pts/209 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 157
158 Chapter 7 The /proc File System
lrwx------    1 samuel   samuel         64 Jan 30 01:30 1 -> /dev/pts/2lrwx------    1 samuel   samuel         64 Jan 30 01:30 2 -> /dev/pts/2lr-x------    1 samuel   samuel         64 Jan 30 01:30 3 -> /etc/fstab
Notice the entry for file descriptor 3, linked to the file /etc/fstab opened on this
descriptor.
File descriptors can be opened on sockets or pipes, too (see Chapter 5 for more
information about these). In such a case, the target of the symbolic link correspondingto the file descriptor will state “socket ”or “pipe”instead of pointing to an ordinary
file or device.
7.2.6 Process Memory Statistics
The statm entry contains a list of seven numbers, separated by spaces. Each number is
a count of the number of pages of memory used by the process in a particular cate-gory.The categories, in the order the numbers appear, are listed here:
nThe total process size
nThe size of the process resident in physical memory
nThe memory shared with other processes —that is, memory mapped both by 
this process and at least one other (such as shared libraries or untouched copy-on-write pages)
nThe text size of the process —that is, the size of loaded executable code 
nThe size of shared libraries mapped into this process
nThe memory used by this process for its stack
nThe number of dirty pages —that is, pages of memory that have been modified
by the program
7.2.7 Process Statistics
The status entry contains a variety of information about the process, formatted for
comprehension by humans.Among this information is the process ID and parentprocess ID, the real and effective user and group IDs, memory usage, and bit masksspecifying which signals are caught, ignored, and blocked.
7.3 Hardware Information
Several of the other entries in the /proc file system provide access to information
about the system hardware.Although these are typically of interest to system configu-rators and administrators, the information may occasionally be of use to applicationprogrammers as well.We ’ll present some of the more useful entries here.09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 158
159 7.3 Hardware Information
7.3.1 CPU Information
As shown previously, /proc/cpuinfo contains information about the CPU or CPUs
running the GNU/Linux system.The Processor field lists the processor number; this is0 for single-processor systems.The Vendor, CPU Family, Model, and Stepping fieldsenable you to determine the exact model and revision of the CPU. More useful, theFlags field shows which CPU flags are set, which indicates the features available in this CPU. For example, “mmx”indicates the availability of the extended MMX
instructions.
3
Most of the information returned from /proc/cpuinfo is derived from the cpuid
x86 assembly instruction.This instruction is the low-level mechanism by which a pro-gram obtains information about the CPU. For a greater understanding of the outputof 
/proc/cpuinfo , see the documentation of the cpuid instruction in Intel ’s IA-32 Intel
Architecture Software Developer’s Manual,Volume 2: Instruction Set Reference .This manual is
available from http://developer.intel.com/design .
The last element, bogomips , is a Linux-specific value. It is a measurement of the
processor ’s speed spinning in a tight loop and is therefore a rather poor indicator of
overall processor speed.
7.3.2 Device Information
The /proc/devices file lists major device numbers for character and block devices
available to the system. See Chapter 6, “Devices, ”for information about types of
devices and device numbers.
7.3.3 PCI Bus Information
The /proc/pci file lists a summary of devices attached to the PCI bus or buses.These
are actual PCI expansion cards and may also include devices built into the system ’s
motherboard, plus AGP graphics cards.The listing includes the device type; the deviceand vendor ID; a device name, if available; information about the features offered bythe device; and information about the PCI resources used by the device.
7.3.4 Serial Port Information
The /proc/tty/driver/serial file lists configuration information and statistics about
serial ports. Serial ports are numbered from 0.4Configuration information about serial
ports can also be obtained, as well as modified, using the setserial command.
However, /proc/tty/driver/serial displays additional statistics about each serial
port’s interrupt counts.
3. See the IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual for documentation about MMX
instructions, and see Chapter 9, “Inline Assembly Code, ”in this book for information on how to
use these and other special assembly instructions in GNU/Linux programs.
4. Note that under DOS and Windows, serial ports are numbered from 1, so COM1 corresponds
to serial port number 0 under Linux.09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 159
160 Chapter 7 The /proc File System
For example, this line from /proc/tty/driver/serial might describe serial port 1
(which would be COM2 under Windows):
1: uart:16550A port:2F8 irq:3 baud:9600 tx:11 rx:0 
This indicates that the serial port is run by a 16550A-type UART, uses I/O port 0x2f8and IRQ 3 for communication, and runs at 9,600 baud.The serial port has seen 11transmit interrupts and 0 receive interrupts.
See Section 6.4, “Hardware Devices, ”for information about serial devices.
7.4 Kernel Information
Many of the entries in /proc provide access to information about the running kernel ’s
configuration and state. Some of these entries are at the top level of /proc ; others are
under /proc/sys/kernel .
7.4.1 Version Information
The file /proc/version contains a long string describing the kernel ’s release number
and build version. It also includes information about how the kernel was built: theuser who compiled it, the machine on which it was compiled, the date it was com-piled, and the compiler release that was used —for example:
% cat /proc/version Linux version 2.2.14-5.0 (root@porky.devel.redhat.com) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #1 Tue Mar 721:07:39 EST 2000
This indicates that the system is running a 2.2.14 release of the Linux kernel, whichwas compiled with EGCS release 1.1.2. (EGCS, the Experimental GNU Compiler
System , was a precursor to the current GCC project.) 
The most important items in this output, the OS name and kernel version 
and revision, are available in separate 
/proc entries as well.These are /proc/sys/
kernel/ostype ,/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease , and /proc/sys/kernel/version ,
respectively.
% cat /proc/sys/kernel/ostype Linux% cat /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease 2.2.14-5.0% cat /proc/sys/kernel/version #1 Tue Mar 7 21:07:39 EST 2000
7.4.2 Hostname and Domain Name
The /proc/sys/kernel/hostname and /proc/sys/kernel/domainname entries contain
the computer ’s hostname and domain name, respectively.This information is the same
as that returned by the uname system call, described in Section 8.15.09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 160
161 7.5 Drives, Mounts, and File Systems
7.4.3 Memory Usage
The /proc/meminfo entry contains information about the system ’s memory usage.
Information is presented both for physical memory and for swap space.The first threelines present memory totals, in bytes; subsequent lines summarize this information inkilobytes —for example:
% cat /proc/meminfo 
total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  529694720 519610368 10084352 82612224 10977280 82108416Swap: 271392768 44003328 227389440MemTotal:    517280 kBMemFree:       9848 kBMemShared:    80676 kBBuffers:      10720 kBCached:       80184 kBBigTotal:         0 kBBigFree:          0 kBSwapTotal:   265032 kBSwapFree:    222060 kB
This shows 512MB physical memory, of which about 9MB is free, and 258MB ofswap space, of which 216MB is free. In the row corresponding to physical memory,three other values are presented:
nThe Shared column displays total shared memory currently allocated on the sys-tem (see Section 5.1, “Shared Memory ”).
nThe Buffers column displays the memory allocated by Linux for block devicebuffers.These buffers are used by device drivers to hold blocks of data beingread from and written to disk.
nThe Cached column displays the memory allocated by Linux to the page cache.This memory is used to cache accesses to mapped files.
Y ou can use the 
free command to display the same memory information.
7.5 Drives, Mounts, and File Systems
The /proc file system also contains information about the disk drives present in the
system and the file systems mounted from them.
7.5.1 File Systems
The /proc/filesystems entry displays the file system types known to the kernel. Note
that this list isn ’t very useful because it is not complete: File systems can be loaded and
unloaded dynamically as kernel modules.The contents of /proc/filesystems list only
file system types that either are statically linked into the kernel or are currently loaded.Other file system types may be available on the system as modules but might not beloaded yet.09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 161

7.5.2 Drives and Partitions
The /proc file system includes information about devices connected to both IDE
controllers and SCSI controllers (if the system includes them).
On typical systems, the /proc/ide subdirectory may contain either or both of two
subdirectories, ide0 and ide1, corresponding to the primary and secondary IDE con-
trollers on the system.5These contain further subdirectories corresponding to physical
devices attached to the controllers.The controller or device directories may be absentif Linux has not recognized any connected devices.The full paths corresponding tothe four possible IDE devices are listed in Table 7.1.
Table 7.1 Full Paths Corresponding to the Four Possible IDE Devices
Controller Device SubdirectoryPrimary Master
/proc/ide/ide0/hda/
Primary Slave /proc/ide/ide0/hdb/
Secondary Master /proc/ide/ide1/hdc/
Secondary Slave /proc/ide/ide1/hdd/
See Section 6.4, “Hardware Devices, ”for more information about IDE device names.
Each IDE device directory contains several entries providing access to identification
and configuration information for the device.A few of the most useful are listed here:
nmodel contains the device ’s model identification string.
nmedia contains the device ’s media type. Possible values are disk,cdrom ,tape,
floppy , and UNKNOWN .
ncapacity contains the device ’s capacity, in 512-byte blocks. Note that for CD-
ROM devices, the value will be 231–1, not the capacity of the disk in the drive.
Note that the value in capacity represents the capacity of the entire physical
disk; the capacity of file systems contained in partitions of the disk will besmaller.
For example, these commands show how to determine the media type and deviceidentification for the master device on the secondary IDE controller. In this case, itturns out to be a T oshiba CD-ROM drive.
% cat /proc/ide/ide1/hdc/media cdrom% cat /proc/ide/ide1/hdc/modelTOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-6702B
5. If properly configured, the Linux kernel can support additional IDE controllers.These are
numbered sequentially from ide2.09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 162
163 7.5 Drives, Mounts, and File Systems
If SCSI devices are present in the system, /proc/scsi/scsi contains a summary of
their identification values. For example, the contents might look like this:
% cat /proc/scsi/scsi Attached devices: Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
Vendor: QUANTUM  Model: ATLAS_V__9_WLS   Rev: 0230Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 03
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 04 Lun: 00
Vendor: QUANTUM  Model: QM39100TD-SW     Rev: N491Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
This computer contains one single-channel SCSI controller (designated “scsi0”), to
which two Quantum disk drives are connected, with SCSI device IDs 0 and 4.
The /proc/partitions entry displays the partitions of recognized disk devices. For
each partition, the output includes the major and minor device number, the numberof 1024-byte blocks, and the device name corresponding to that partition.
The 
/proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info entry displays miscellaneous information about the
capabilities of CD-ROM drives.The fields are self-explanatory:
%  cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info CD-ROM information, Id: cdrom.c 2.56 1999/09/09drive name:  hdcdrive speed:  48drive # of slots:  0Can close tray:  1Can open tray:  1Can lock tray:  1Can change speed:  1Can select disk:  0Can read multisession:  1Can read MCN:  1Reports media changed:  1Can play audio:  1
7.5.3 Mounts
The /proc/mounts file provides a summary of mounted file systems. Each line corre-
sponds to a single mount descriptor and lists the mounted device, the mount point, and
other information. Note that /proc/mounts contains the same information as the ordi-
nary file /etc/mtab , which is automatically updated by the mount command.
These are the elements of a mount descriptor:
nThe first element on the line is the mounted device (see Chapter 6). For specialfile systems such as the 
/proc file system, this is none.
nThe second element is the mount point , the place in the root file system at which
the file system contents appear. For the root file system itself, the mount point islisted as 
/. For swap drives, the mount point is listed as swap.09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 163
164 Chapter 7 The /proc File System
nThe third element is the file system type. Currently, most GNU/Linux systemsuse the 
ext2 file system for disk drives, but DOS or Windows drives may be
mounted with other file system types, such as fator vfat. Most CD-ROMs
contain an iso9660 file system. See the man page for the mount command for a
list of file system types.
nThe fourth element lists mount flags.These are options that were specified whenthe mount was added. See the man page for the 
mount command for an expla-
nation of flags for the various file system types.
In /proc/mounts , the last two elements are always 0 and have no meaning.
See the man page for fstab for details about the format of mount descriptors.6
GNU/Linux includes functions to help you parse mount descriptors; see the manpage for the 
getmntent function for information on using these.
7.5.4 Locks
Section 8.3, “fcntl : Locks and Other File Operations, ”describes how to use the fcntl
system call to manipulate read and write locks on files.The /proc/locks entry
describes all the file locks currently outstanding in the system. Each row in the outputcorresponds to one lock.
For locks created with 
fcntl , the first two entries on the line are POSIX ADVISORY .
The third is WRITE or READ, depending on the lock type.The next number is the
process ID of the process holding the lock.The following three numbers, separated bycolons, are the major and minor device numbers of the device on which the fileresides and the inode number, which locates the file in the file system.The remainder
of the line lists values internal to the kernel that are not of general utility.
Turning the contents of 
/proc/locks into useful information takes some detective
work.Y ou can watch /proc/locks in action, for instance, by running the program in
Listing 8.2 to create a write lock on the file /tmp/test-file .
% touch /tmp/test-file% ./lock-file /tmp/test-filefile /tmp/test-fileopening /tmp/test-filelockinglocked; hit enter to unlock... 
In another window, look at the contents of /proc/locks .
% cat /proc/locks1: POSIX  ADVISORY  WRITE 5467 08:05:181288 0 2147483647 d1b5f740 00000000dfea7d40 00000000 00000000
6.The /etc/fstab file lists the static mount configuration of the GNU/Linux system.09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 164
165 7.6 System Statistics
There may be other lines of output, too, corresponding to locks held by other pro-grams. In this case, 5467 is the process ID of the 
lock-file program. Use psto figure
out what this process is running.
% ps 5467
PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
5467 pts/28   S      0:00 ./lock-file /tmp/test-file
The locked file, /tmp/test-file , resides on the device that has major and minor
device numbers 8 and 5, respectively.These numbers happen to correspond to
/dev/sda5 .
% df /tmpFilesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on/dev/sda5              8459764   5094292   2935736  63% /% ls -l /dev/sda5brw-rw----    1 root     disk       8,   5 May  5  1998 /dev/sda5
The file /tmp/test-file itself is at inode 181,288 on that device.
% ls --inode /tmp/test-file 
181288 /tmp/test-file
See Section 6.2, “Device Numbers, ”for more information about device numbers.
7.6 System Statistics
T wo entries in /proc contain useful system statistics.The /proc/loadavg file contains
information about the system load.The first three numbers represent the number ofactive tasks on the system —processes that are actually running —averaged over the last
1, 5, and 15 minutes.The next entry shows the instantaneous current number ofrunnable tasks —processes that are currently scheduled to run rather than being blocked
in a system call —and the total number of processes on the system.The final entry is
the process ID of the process that most recently ran.
The 
/proc/uptime file contains the length of time since the system was booted, as
well as the amount of time since then that the system has been idle. Both are given asfloating-point values, in seconds.
% cat /proc/uptime3248936.18 3072330.49
The program in Listing 7.7 extracts the uptime and idle time from the system and dis-plays them in friendly units.
Listing 7.7 (print-uptime.c ) Print the System Uptime and Idle Time

}
The uptime command and the sysinfo system call (see Section 8.14, “sysinfo :
Obtaining System Statistics ”) also can obtain the system ’s uptime.The uptime
command also displays the load averages found in /proc/loadavg .Listing 7.7 Continued09 0430 CH07  5/22/01  10:30 AM  Page 166
Linux System Calls
8
S OF A R ,WE’VE PRESENTED A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS that your program can invoke
to perform system-related functions, such as parsing command-line options, manipu-lating processes, and mapping memory. If you look under the hood, you ’ll find that
these functions fall into two categories, based on how they are implemented.
nA library function is an ordinary function that resides in a library external to your
program. Most of the library functions we ’ve presented so far are in the standard
C library, libc. For example, getopt_long and mkstemp are functions provided in
the C library.A call to a library function is just like any other function call.The arguments areplaced in processor registers or onto the stack, and execution is transferred tothe start of the function ’s code, which typically resides in a loaded shared library.
nA system call is implemented in the Linux kernel.When a program makes a 
system call, the arguments are packaged up and handed to the kernel, whichtakes over execution of the program until the call completes.A system call isn ’t
an ordinary function call, and a special procedure is required to transfer controlto the kernel. However, the GNU C library (the implementation of the standardC library provided with GNU/Linux systems) wraps Linux system calls withfunctions so that you can call them easily. Low-level I/O functions such as 
open
and read are examples of system calls on Linux.10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 167
168 Chapter 8 Linux System Calls
The set of Linux system calls forms the most basic interface between programsand the Linux kernel. Each call presents a basic operation or capability.Some system calls are very powerful and can exert great influence on the system. For instance, some system calls enable you to shut down the Linux system or to allocate system resources and prevent other users from accessingthem.These calls have the restriction that only processes running with superuserprivilege (programs run by the root account) can invoke them.These calls fail ifinvoked by a nonsuperuser process.
Note that a library function may invoke one or more other library functions or systemcalls as part of its implementation.
Linux currently provides about 200 different system calls.A listing of system calls
for your version of the Linux kernel is in 
/usr/include/asm/unistd.h . Some of these
are for internal use by the system, and others are used only in implementing special-ized library functions. In this chapter, we ’ll present a selection of system calls that are
likely to be the most useful to application and system programmers.
Most of these system calls are declared in 
<unistd.h> .
8.1 Using strace
Before we start discussing system calls, it will be useful to present a command withwhich you can learn about and debug system calls.The 
strace command traces the
execution of another program, listing any system calls the program makes and any sig-nals it receives.
T o watch the system calls and signals in a program, simply invoke 
strace , followed
by the program and its command-line arguments. For example, to watch the systemcalls that are invoked by the 
hostname1command, use this command:
% strace hostname
This produces a couple screens of output. Each line corresponds to a single systemcall. For each call, the system call ’s name is listed, followed by its arguments (or abbre-
viated arguments, if they are very long) and its return value.Where possible,
strace
conveniently displays symbolic names instead of numerical values for arguments andreturn values, and it displays the fields of structures passed by a pointer into the systemcall. Note that 
strace does notshow ordinary function calls.
In the output from strace hostname , the first line shows the execve system call
that invokes the hostname program:2
execve(“/bin/hostname”, [“hostname”], [/* 49 vars */]) = 0
1.hostname invoked without any flags simply prints out the computer ’s hostname to 
standard output.
2. In Linux, the exec family of functions is implemented via the execve system call.10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 168
169 8.2 access: Testing File Permissions
The first argument is the name of the program to run; the second is its argument list,consisting of only a single element; and the third is its environment list, which 
strace
omits for brevity.The next 30 or so lines are part of the mechanism that loads thestandard C library from a shared library file.
T oward the end are system calls that actually help do the program ’s work.The
uname system call is used to obtain the system ’s hostname from the kernel,
uname({sys=”Linux”, node=”myhostname”, ...}) = 0
Observe that strace helpfully labels the fields ( sysand node) of the structure argu-
ment.This structure is filled in by the system call —Linux sets the sysfield to the
operating system name and the node field to the system ’s hostname.The uname call is
discussed further in Section 8.15, “uname .”
Finally, the write system call produces output. Recall that file descriptor 1 corre-
sponds to standard output.The third argument is the number of characters to write,and the return value is the number of characters that were actually written.
write(1, “myhostname\n”, 11)            = 11
This may appear garbled when you run strace because the output from the hostname
program itself is mixed in with the output from strace .
If the program you ’re tracing produces lots of output, it is sometimes more conve-
nient to redirect the output from strace into a file. Use the option -o  filename to
do this.
Understanding all the output from strace requires detailed familiarity with the
design of the Linux kernel and execution environment. Much of this is of limitedinterest to application programmers. However, some understanding is useful for debug-ging tricky problems or understanding how other programs work.
8.2 access:Testing File Permissions
The access system call determines whether the calling process has access permission
to a file. It can check any combination of read, write, and execute permission, and itcan also check for a file ’s existence.
The 
access call takes two arguments.The first is the path to the file to check.The
second is a bitwise or of R_OK,W_OK, and X_OK, corresponding to read, write, and exe-
cute permission.The return value is 0 if the process has all the specified permissions. Ifthe file exists but the calling process does not have the specified permissions,
access
returns –1 and sets errno to EACCES (or EROFS , if write permission was requested for a
file on a read-only file system).
If the second argument is F_OK,access simply checks for the file ’s existence. If the file
exists, the return value is 0; if not, the return value is –1 and errno is set to ENOENT . Note
that errno may instead be set to EACCES if a directory in the file path is inaccessible.10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 169
170 Chapter 8 Linux System Calls
The program shown in Listing 8.1 uses access to check for a file ’s existence and to
determine read and write permissions. Specify the name of the file to check on thecommand line.
Listing 8.1 (check-access.c ) Check File Access Permissions
#include <errno.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
char* path = argv[1];int rval;/* Check file existence.  */rval = access (path, F_OK);if (rval == 0) 
printf (“%s exists\n”, path);
else {
if (errno == ENOENT) 
printf (“%s does not exist\n”, path);
else if (errno == EACCES) 
printf (“%s is not accessible\n”, path);
return 0;
}/* Check read access.  */rval = access (path, R_OK);if (rval == 0)
printf (“%s is readable\n”, path);
else
printf (“%s is not readable (access denied)\n”, path);
/* Check write access.  */rval = access (path, W_OK);if (rval == 0)
printf (“%s is writable\n”, path);
else if (errno == EACCES)
printf (“%s is not writable (access denied)\n”, path);
else if (errno == EROFS)
printf (“%s is not writable (read-only filesystem)\n”, path);
return 0;
}
For example, to check access permissions for a file named README on a CD-ROM,
invoke it like this:
% ./check-access /mnt/cdrom/README/mnt/cdrom/README exists/mnt/cdrom/README is readable/mnt/cdrom/README is not writable (read-only filesystem)10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 170
171 8.3 fcntl: Locks and Other File Operations
8.3 fcntl: Locks and Other File Operations
The fcntl system call is the access point for several advanced operations on file
descriptors.The first argument to fcntl is an open file descriptor, and the second is a
value that indicates which operation is to be performed. For some operations, fcntl
takes an additional argument.We ’ll describe here one of the most useful fcntl opera-
tions, file locking. See the fcntl man page for information about the others.
The fcntl system call allows a program to place a read lock or a write lock on a
file, somewhat analogous to the mutex locks discussed in Chapter 5, “Interprocess
Communication. ”A read lock is placed on a readable file descriptor, and a write lock
is placed on a writable file descriptor. More than one process may hold a read lock onthe same file at the same time, but only one process may hold a write lock, and thesame file may not be both locked for read and locked for write. Note that placing alock does not actually prevent other processes from opening the file, reading from it,or writing to it, unless they acquire locks with 
fcntl as well.
T o place a lock on a file, first create and zero out a struct flock variable. Set the
l_type field of the structure to F_RDLCK for a read lock or F_WRLCK for a write lock.
Then call fcntl , passing a file descriptor to the file, the F_SETLCKW operation code, and
a pointer to the struct flock variable. If another process holds a lock that prevents a
new lock from being acquired, fcntl blocks until that lock is released.
The program in Listing 8.2 opens a file for writing whose name is provided on the
command line, and then places a write lock on it.The program waits for the user tohit Enter and then unlocks and closes the file.
Listing 8.2 (lock-file.c ) Create a Write Lock with fcntl
#include <fcntl.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
char* file = argv[1];int fd;struct flock lock;printf (“opening %s\n”, file);/* Open a file descriptor to the file.  */fd = open (file, O_WRONLY);printf (“locking\n”);/* Initialize the flock structure.  */memset (&lock, 0, sizeof(lock));lock.l_type = F_WRLCK;/* Place a write lock on the file.  */fcntl (fd, F_SETLKW, &lock);
continues10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 171
172 Chapter 8 Linux System Calls
printf (“locked; hit Enter to unlock... “);/* Wait for the user to hit Enter.  */getchar ();printf (“unlocking\n”);/* Release the lock.  */lock.l_type = F_UNLCK;fcntl (fd, F_SETLKW, &lock);close (fd);return 0;
}
Compile and run the program on a test file —say,/tmp/test-file —like this:
% cc -o lock-file lock-file.c% touch /tmp/test-file% ./lock-file /tmp/test-fileopening /tmp/test-filelockinglocked; hit Enter to unlock...
Now, in another window, try running it again on the same file.
% ./lock-file /tmp/test-fileopening /tmp/test-filelocking
Note that the second instance is blocked while attempting to lock the file. Go back tothe first window and press Enter:
unlocking
The program running in the second window immediately acquires the lock.
If you prefer fcntl not to block if the call cannot get the lock you requested,
use F_SETLK instead of F_SETLKW . If the lock cannot be acquired, fcntl returns –1
immediately.
Linux provides another implementation of file locking with the flock call.The
fcntl version has a major advantage: It works with files on NFS3file systems (as long
as the NFS server is reasonably recent and correctly configured). So, if you have accessto two machines that both mount the same file system via NFS, you can repeat theprevious example using two different machines. Run 
lock-file on one machine,
specifying a file on an NFS file system, and then run it again on another machine,specifying the same file. NFS wakes up the second program when the lock is releasedby the first program.
3.Network File System (NFS) is a common network file sharing technology, comparable to
Windows ’shares and network drives.Listing 8.2 Continued10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 172
173 8.4 fsync and fdatasync: Flushing Disk Buffers
8.4 fsyncand fdatasync : Flushing Disk Buffers
On most operating systems, when you write to a file, the data is not immediatelywritten to disk. Instead, the operating system caches the written data in a memorybuffer, to reduce the number of required disk writes and improve program responsive-ness.When the buffer fills or some other condition occurs (for instance, enough timeelapses), the system writes the cached data to disk all at one time.
Linux provides caching of this type as well. Normally, this is a great boon to perfor-
mance. However, this behavior can make programs that depend on the integrity ofdisk-based records unreliable. If the system goes down suddenly —for instance, due to a
kernel crash or power outage —any data written by a program that is in the memory
cache but has not yet been written to disk is lost.
For example, suppose that you are writing a transaction-processing program that
keeps a journal file.The journal file contains records of all transactions that have beenprocessed so that if a system failure occurs, the state of the transaction data can bereconstructed. It is obviously important to preserve the integrity of the journal file —
whenever a transaction is processed, its journal entry should be sent to the disk driveimmediately.
T o help you implement this, Linux provides the 
fsync system call. It takes one
argument, a writable file descriptor, and flushes to disk any data written to this file.The 
fsync call doesn ’t return until the data has physically been written.
The function in Listing 8.3 illustrates the use of fsync . It writes a single-line entry
to a journal file.
Listing 8.3 (write_journal_entry.c ) Write and Sync a Journal Entry
#include <fcntl.h>#include <string.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>const char* journal_filename = “journal.log”;void write_journal_entry (char* entry){
int fd = open (journal_filename, O_WRONLY 
|O_CREAT |O_APPEND, 0660);
write (fd, entry, strlen (entry));write (fd, “\n”, 1);fsync (fd);close (fd);
}
Another system call, fdatasync does the same thing. However, although fsync guaran-
tees that the file ’s modification time will be updated, fdatasync does not; it guarantees
only that the file ’s data will be written.This means that in principal, fdatasync can
execute faster than fsync because it needs to force only one disk write instead of two.10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 173
174 Chapter 8 Linux System Calls
However, in current versions of Linux, these two system calls actually do the samething, both updating the file ’s modification time.
The 
fsync system call enables you to force a buffer write explicitly.Y ou can also
open a file for synchronous I/O , which causes all writes to be committed to disk imme-
diately.T o do this, specify the O_SYNC flag when opening the file with the open call.
8.5 getrlimit and setrlimit : Resource Limits
The getrlimit and setrlimit system calls allow a process to read and set limits on the
system resources that it can consume.Y ou may be familiar with the ulimit shell com-
mand, which enables you to restrict the resource usage of programs you run;4these
system calls allow a program to do this programmatically.
For each resource there are two limits, the hard limit and the soft limit .The soft limit
may never exceed the hard limit, and only processes with superuser privilege maychange the hard limit.T ypically, an application program will reduce the soft limit toplace a throttle on the resources it uses.
Both 
getrlimit and setrlimit take as arguments a code specifying the resource
limit type and a pointer to a structrlimit variable.The getrlimit call fills the fields
of this structure, while the setrlimit call changes the limit based on its contents.The
rlimit structure has two fields: rlim_cur is the soft limit, and rlim_max is the hard
limit.
Some of the most useful resource limits that may be changed are listed here, with
their codes:
nRLIMIT_CPU —The maximum CPU time, in seconds, used by a program.This is
the amount of time that the program is actually executing on the CPU, which isnot necessarily the same as wall-clock time. If the program exceeds this timelimit, it is terminated with a 
SIGXCPU signal.
nRLIMIT_DATA —The maximum amount of memory that a program can allocate
for its data.Additional allocation beyond this limit will fail.
nRLIMIT_NPROC —The maximum number of child processes that can be running
for this user. If the process calls fork and too many processes belonging to this
user are running on the system, fork fails.
nRLIMIT_NOFILE —The maximum number of file descriptors that the process may
have open at one time.
See the setrlimit man page for a full list of system resources.
The program in Listing 8.4 illustrates setting the limit on CPU time consumed by
a program. It sets a 1-second CPU time limit and then spins in an infinite loop. Linuxkills the process soon afterward, when it exceeds 1 second of CPU time.
4. See the man page for your shell for more information about ulimit .10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 174
175 8.6 getrusage: Process Statistics
Listing 8.4 (limit-cpu.c ) CPU Time Limit Demonstration
#include <sys/resource.h>#include <sys/time.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (){
struct rlimit rl;/* Obtain the current limits.  */getrlimit (RLIMIT_CPU, &rl);/* Set a CPU limit of 1 second.  */rl.rlim_cur = 1;setrlimit (RLIMIT_CPU, &rl);/* Do busy work.  */while (1);return 0;
}
When the program is terminated by SIGXCPU , the shell helpfully prints out a message
interpreting the signal:
% ./limit_cpuCPU time limit exceeded
8.6 getrusage : Process Statistics
The getrusage system call retrieves process statistics from the kernel. It can be used to
obtain statistics either for the current process by passing RUSAGE_SELF as the first argu-
ment, or for all terminated child processes that were forked by this process and its children by passing 
RUSAGE_CHILDREN .The second argument to rusage is a pointer 
to a struct rusage variable, which is filled with the statistics.
A few of the more interesting fields in struct rusage are listed here:
nru_utime —A struct timeval field containing the amount of user time , in sec-
onds, that the process has used. User time is CPU time spent executing the userprogram, rather than in kernel system calls.
nru_stime —A struct timeval field containing the amount of system time , in sec-
onds, that the process has used. System time is the CPU time spent executingsystem calls on behalf of the process.
nru_maxrss —The largest amount of physical memory occupied by the process ’s
data at one time over the course of its execution.
The getrusage man page lists all the available fields. See Section 8.7, “gettimeofday :
Wall-Clock Time, ”for information about struct timeval .10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 175
176 Chapter 8 Linux System Calls
The function in Listing 8.5 prints out the current process ’s user and system time.

usage.ru_utime.tv_sec, usage.ru_utime.tv_usec,usage.ru_stime.tv_sec, usage.ru_stime.tv_usec);
}
8.7 gettimeofday :Wall-Clock Time
The gettimeofday system call gets the system ’s wall-clock time. It takes a pointer to a
struct timeval variable.This structure represents a time, in seconds, split into two
fields.The tv_sec field contains the integral number of seconds, and the tv_usec field
contains an additional number of microseconds.This struct timeval value represents
the number of seconds elapsed since the start of the UNIX epoch , on midnight UTC
on January 1, 1970.The gettimeofday call also takes a second argument, which should
be NULL. Include <sys/time.h> if you use this system call.
The number of seconds in the UNIX epoch isn ’t usually a very handy way of rep-
resenting dates.The localtime and strftime library functions help manipulate the
return value of gettimeofday .The localtime function takes a pointer to the number
of seconds (the tv_sec field of struct timeval ) and returns a pointer to a struct tm
object.This structure contains more useful fields, which are filled according to thelocal time zone:
ntm_hour ,tm_min ,tm_sec —The time of day, in hours, minutes, and seconds.
ntm_year ,tm_mon ,tm_day —The year, month, and date.
ntm_wday —The day of the week. Zero represents Sunday.
ntm_yday —The day of the year.
ntm_isdst —A flag indicating whether daylight savings time is in effect.
The strftime function additionally can produce from the struct tm pointer a cus-
tomized, formatted string displaying the date and time.The format is specified in amanner similar to 
printf , as a string with embedded codes indicating which time
fields to include. For example, this format string
“%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S”10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 176
177 8.8 The mlock Family: Locking Physical Memory
specifies the date and time in this form:
2001-01-14 13:09:42
Pass strftime a character buffer to receive the string, the length of that buffer, the for-
mat string, and a pointer to a struct tm variable. See the strftime man page for a
complete list of codes that can be used in the format string. Notice that neither
localtime nor strftime handles the fractional part of the current time more precise
than 1 second (the tv_usec field of struct timeval ). If you want this in your format-
ted time strings, you ’ll have to include it yourself.
Include <time.h> if you call localtime or strftime .
The function in Listing 8.6 prints the current date and time of day, down to the
millisecond.
Listing 8.6 (print-time.c ) Print Date and Time
#include <stdio.h>#include <sys/time.h>#include <time.h>#include <unistd.h>void print_time (){
struct timeval tv;struct tm* ptm;char time_string[40];long milliseconds;/* Obtain the time of day, and convert it to a tm struct.  */gettimeofday (&tv, NULL);ptm = localtime (&tv.tv_sec);/* Format the date and time, down to a single second.  */strftime (time_string, sizeof (time_string), “%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S”, ptm);/* Compute milliseconds from microseconds.  */milliseconds = tv.tv_usec / 1000;/* Print the formatted time, in seconds, followed by a decimal point
and the milliseconds.  */
printf (“%s.%03ld\n”, time_string, milliseconds);
}
8.8 The mlock Family: Locking Physical
Memory
The mlock family of system calls allows a program to lock some or all of its address
space into physical memory.This prevents Linux from paging this memory to swapspace, even if the program hasn ’t accessed it for a while.10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 177
178 Chapter 8 Linux System Calls
A time-critical program might lock physical memory because the time delay of
paging memory out and back may be too long or too unpredictable. High-securityapplications may also want to prevent sensitive data from being written out to a swapfile, where they might be recovered by an intruder after the program terminates.
Locking a region of memory is as simple as calling 
mlock with a pointer to the start
of the region and the region ’s length. Linux divides memory into pages and can lock
only entire pages at a time; each page that contains part of the memory region speci-fied to 
mlock is locked.The getpagesize function returns the system ’s page size, which
is 4KB on x86 Linux.
For example, to allocate 32MB of address space and lock it into RAM, you would
use this code:
const int alloc_size = 32 * 1024 * 1024;char* memory = malloc (alloc_size);mlock (memory, alloc_size);
Note that simply allocating a page of memory and locking it with mlock doesn ’t
reserve physical memory for the calling process because the pages may be copy-on-write.
5Therefore, you should write a dummy value to each page as well:
size_t i;size_t page_size = getpagesize ();for (i = 0; i < alloc_size; i += page_size)
memory[i] = 0;
The write to each page forces Linux to assign a unique, unshared memory page to theprocess for that page.
T o unlock a region, call 
munlock , which takes the same arguments as mlock .
If you want your program ’s entire address space locked into physical memory, call
mlockall . This system call takes a single flag argument: MCL_CURRENT locks all currently
allocated memory, but future allocations are not locked; MCL_FUTURE locks all pages that
are allocated after the call. Use MCL_CURRENT |MCL_FUTURE to lock into memory both
current and subsequent allocations.
Locking large amounts of memory, especially using mlockall , can be dangerous to
the entire Linux system. Indiscriminate memory locking is a good method of bringingyour system to a grinding halt because other running processes are forced to competefor smaller physical memory resources and swap rapidly into and back out of memory(this is known as thrashing ). If you lock too much memory, the system will run out of
memory entirely and Linux will start killing off processes.
For this reason, only processes with superuser privilege may lock memory with
mlock or mlockall . If a nonsuperuser process calls one of these functions, it will fail,
return –1, and set errno to EPERM .
The munlockall call unlocks all memory locked by the current process, including
memory locked with mlock and mlockall .
5.Copy-on-write means that Linux makes a private copy of a page of memory for a process
only when that process writes a value somewhere into it.10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 178
179 8.9 mprotect: Setting Memory Permissions
A convenient way to monitor the memory usage of your program is to use the top
command. In the output from top, the SIZE column displays the virtual address space
size of each program (the total size of your program ’s code, data, and stack, some of
which may be paged out to swap space).The RSScolumn (for resident set size ) shows
the size of physical memory that each program currently resides in.The sum of all theRSS values for all running programs cannot exceed your computer ’s physical memory
size, and the sum of all address space sizes is limited to 2GB (for 32-bit versions ofLinux).
Include 
<sys/mman.h> if you use any of the mlock system calls.
8.9 mprotect : Setting Memory Permissions
In Section 5.3, “Mapped Memory, ”we showed how to use the mmap system call to
map a file into memory. Recall that the third argument to mmap is a bitwise or of
memory protection flags PROT_READ ,PROT_WRITE , and PROT_EXEC for read, write, and
execute permission, respectively, or PROT_NONE for no memory access. If a program
attempts to perform an operation on a memory location that is not allowed by thesepermissions, it is terminated with a 
SIGSEGV (segmentation violation) signal.
After memory has been mapped, these permissions can be modified with the 
mprotect system call.The arguments to mprotect are an address of a memory region,
the size of the region, and a set of protection flags.The memory region must consist ofentire pages:The address of the region must be aligned to the system ’s page size, and
the length of the region must be a page size multiple.The protection flags for thesepages are replaced with the specified value.
Obtaining Page-Aligned Memory
Note that memory regions returned by malloc are typically not page-aligned, even if the size of the
memory is a multiple of the page size. If you want to protect memory obtained from malloc , you will
have to allocate a larger memory region and find a page-aligned region within it.Alternately, you can use the 
mmap system call to bypass malloc and allocate page-aligned memory
directly from the Linux kernel. See Section 5.3, “Mapped Memory, ” for details.
For example, suppose that your program allocates a page of memory by mapping
/dev/zero , as described in Section 5.3.5, “Other Uses for mmap.”The memory is ini-
tially both readable and writable.
int fd = open (“/dev/zero”, O_RDONLY);char* memory = mmap (NULL, page_size, PROT_READ 
|PROT_WRITE, 
MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
close (fd);
Later, your program could make the memory read-only by calling mprotect :
mprotect (memory, page_size, PROT_READ);10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 179
180 Chapter 8 Linux System Calls
An advanced technique to monitor memory access is to protect the region of memoryusing 
mmap or mprotect and then handle the SIGSEGV signal that Linux sends to the
program when it tries to access that memory.The example in Listing 8.7 illustrates thistechnique.
Listing 8.7 (mprotect.c ) Detect Memory Access Using mprotect
#include <fcntl.h>#include <signal.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>#include <sys/mman.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>static int alloc_size;static char* memory;void segv_handler (int signal_number) {
printf (“memory accessed!\n”);mprotect (memory, alloc_size, PROT_READ 
|PROT_WRITE);
}  int main (){
int fd;struct sigaction sa;/* Install segv_handler as the handler for SIGSEGV.  */memset (&sa, 0, sizeof (sa));sa.sa_handler = &segv_handler;sigaction (SIGSEGV, &sa, NULL);/* Allocate one page of memory by mapping /dev/zero.  Map the memory
as write-only, initially.  */
alloc_size = getpagesize ();fd = open (“/dev/zero”, O_RDONLY);memory = mmap (NULL, alloc_size, PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);close (fd);/* Write to the page to obtain a private copy.  */memory[0] = 0;/* Make the memory unwritable.  */mprotect (memory, alloc_size, PROT_NONE);/* Write to the allocated memory region.  */memory[0] = 1;10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 180
181 8.10 nanosleep: High-Precision Sleeping
/* All done; unmap the memory.  */printf (“all done\n”);munmap (memory, alloc_size);return 0;
}
The program follows these steps:
1. The program installs a signal handler for SIGSEGV .
2. The program allocates a page of memory by mapping /dev/zero and writing a
value to the allocated page to obtain a private copy.
3. The program protects the memory by calling mprotect with the PROT_NONE
permission.
4. When the program subsequently writes to memory, Linux sends it SIGSEGV ,
which is handled by segv_handler .The signal handler unprotects the memory,
which allows the memory access to proceed.
5. When the signal handler completes, control returns to main, where the program
deallocates the memory using munmap .
8.10 nanosleep : High-Precision Sleeping
The nanosleep system call is a high-precision version of the standard UNIX sleep
call. Instead of sleeping an integral number of seconds, nanosleep takes as its argument
a pointer to a struct timespec object, which can express time to nanosecond preci-
sion. However, because of the details of how the Linux kernel works, the actual precision provided by 
nanosleep is 10 milliseconds —still better than that afforded by
sleep .This additional precision can be useful, for instance, to schedule frequent opera-
tions with short time intervals between them.
The struct timespec structure has two fields: tv_sec , the integral number of sec-
onds, and tv_nsec , an additional number of milliseconds.The value of tv_nsec must
be less than 109.
The nanosleep call provides another advantage over sleep .As with sleep , the
delivery of a signal interrupts the execution of nanosleep , which sets errno to EINTR
and returns –1. However, nanosleep takes a second argument, another pointer to a
struct timespec object, which, if not null, is filled with the amount of time remain-
ing (that is, the difference between the requested sleep time and the actual sleep time).This makes it easy to resume the sleep operation.
The function in Listing 8.8 provides an alternate implementation of 
sleep . Unlike
the ordinary system call, this function takes a floating-point value for the number ofseconds to sleep and restarts the sleep operation if it ’s interrupted by a signal.10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 181
182 Chapter 8 Linux System Calls
Listing 8.8 (better_sleep.c ) High-Precision Sleep Function
#include <errno.h>#include <time.h>int better_sleep (double sleep_time){
struct timespec tv;/* Construct the timespec from the number of whole seconds...  */tv.tv_sec = (time_t) sleep_time;/* ... and the remainder in nanoseconds.  */tv.tv_nsec = (long) ((sleep_time - tv.tv_sec) * 1e+9);while (1){
/* Sleep for the time specified in tv.  If interrupted by a
signal, place the remaining time left to sleep back into tv.  */
int rval = nanosleep (&tv, &tv);if (rval == 0)
/* Completed the entire sleep time; all done.  */return 0;
else if (errno == EINTR)
/* Interrupted by a signal.  Try again.  */continue;
else 
/* Some other error; bail out.  */return rval;
}return 0;
}
8.11 readlink : Reading Symbolic Links
The readlink system call retrieves the target of a symbolic link. It takes three argu-
ments: the path to the symbolic link, a buffer to receive the target of the link, and thelength of that buffer. Unusually,
readlink does not NUL-terminate the target path
that it fills into the buffer. It does, however, return the number of characters in the target path, so NUL-terminating the string is simple.
If the first argument to 
readlink points to a file that isn ’t a symbolic link, readlink
sets errno to EINVAL and returns –1.
The small program in Listing 8.9 prints the target of the symbolic link specified on
its command line.10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 182
183 8.12 sendfile: Fast Data Transfers
Listing 8.9 (print-symlink.c ) Print the Target of a Symbolic Link
#include <errno.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
char target_path[256];char* link_path = argv[1];/* Attempt to read the target of the symbolic link.  */int len = readlink (link_path, target_path, sizeof (target_path));if (len == -1) {
/* The call failed.  */if (errno == EINVAL)
/* It’s not a symbolic link; report that.  */fprintf (stderr, “%s is not a symbolic link\n”, link_path);
else
/* Some other problem occurred; print the generic message.  */perror (“readlink”);
return 1;
}else {
/* NUL-terminate the target path.  */target_path[len] = ‘\0’;/* Print it.  */printf (“%s\n”, target_path);return 0;
}
}
For example, here ’s how you could make a symbolic link and use print-symlink to
read it back:
% ln -s /usr/bin/wc my_link% ./print-symlink my_link/usr/bin/wc
8.12 sendfile : Fast Data Transfers
The sendfile system call provides an efficient mechanism for copying data from one
file descriptor to another.The file descriptors may be open to disk files, sockets, orother devices.
T ypically, to copy from one file descriptor to another, a program allocates a fixed-
size buffer, copies some data from one descriptor into the buffer, writes the buffer outto the other descriptor, and repeats until all the data has been copied.This is inefficientin both time and space because it requires additional memory for the buffer and per-forms an extra copy of the data into that buffer.10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 183
184 Chapter 8 Linux System Calls
Using sendfile , the intermediate buffer can be eliminated. Call sendfile , passing
the file descriptor to write to; the descriptor to read from; a pointer to an offset vari-able; and the number of bytes to transfer.The offset variable contains the offset in theinput file from which the read should start (0 indicates the beginning of the file) andis updated to the position in the file after the transfer.The return value is the numberof bytes transferred. Include 
<sys/sendfile.h> in your program if it uses sendfile .
The program in Listing 8.10 is a simple but extremely efficient implementation of
a file copy.When invoked with two filenames on the command line, it copies the con-tents of the first file into a file named by the second. It uses 
fstat to determine the
size, in bytes, of the source file.
Listing 8.10 (copy.c) File Copy Using sendfile
#include <fcntl.h>#include <stdlib.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <sys/sendfile.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
int read_fd;int write_fd;struct stat stat_buf;off_t offset = 0;/* Open the input file.  */read_fd = open (argv[1], O_RDONLY);/* Stat the input file to obtain its size.  */fstat (read_fd, &stat_buf);/* Open the output file for writing, with the same permissions as the
source file.  */
write_fd = open (argv[2], O_WRONLY 
|O_CREAT, stat_buf.st_mode);
/* Blast the bytes from one file to the other.  */sendfile (write_fd, read_fd, &offset, stat_buf.st_size);/* Close up.  */close (read_fd);close (write_fd);return 0;
}
The sendfile call can be used in many places to make copies more efficient. One
good example is in a Web server or other network daemon, that serves the contents ofa file over the network to a client program.T ypically, a request is received from asocket connected to the client computer.The server program opens a local disk file to10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 184
185 8.13 setitimer: Setting Interval Timers
retrieve the data to serve and writes the file ’s contents to the network socket. Using
sendfile can speed up this operation considerably. Other steps need to be taken to
make the network transfer as efficient as possible, such as setting the socket parameterscorrectly. However, these are outside the scope of this book.
8.13 setitimer : Setting Interval Timers
The setitimer system call is a generalization of the alarm call. It schedules the delivery
of a signal at some point in the future after a fixed amount of time has elapsed.
A program can set three different types of timers with setitimer :
nIf the timer code is ITIMER_REAL , the process is sent a SIGALRM signal after the
specified wall-clock time has elapsed.
nIf the timer code is ITIMER_VIRTUAL , the process is sent a SIGVTALRM signal after
the process has executed for the specified time.Time in which the process is notexecuting (that is, when the kernel or another process is running) is notcounted.
nIf the timer code is ITIMER_PROF , the process is sent a SIGPROF signal when the
specified time has elapsed either during the process ’s own execution or the 
execution of a system call on behalf of the process.
The first argument to setitimer is the timer code, specifying which timer to set.
The second argument is a pointer to a struct itimerval object specifying the new
settings for that timer.The third argument, if not null, is a pointer to another 
struct itimerval object that receives the old timer settings.
A struct itimerval variable has two fields:
nit_value is a struct timeval field that contains the time until the timer next
expires and a signal is sent. If this is 0, the timer is disabled.
nit_interval is another struct timeval field containing the value to which the
timer will be reset after it expires. If this is 0, the timer will be disabled after itexpires. If this is nonzero, the timer is set to expire repeatedly after this interval.
The 
struct timeval type is described in Section 8.7, “gettimeofday :Wall-Clock
Time. ”
The program in Listing 8.11 illustrates the use of setitimer to track the execution
time of a program.A timer is configured to expire every 250 milliseconds and send a
SIGVTALRM signal.

setitimer (ITIMER_VIRTUAL, &timer, NULL);/* Do busy work.  */while (1);
}
8.14 sysinfo : Obtaining System Statistics
The sysinfo system call fills a structure with system statistics. Its only argument is a
pointer to a struct sysinfo . Some of the more interesting fields of struct sysinfo
that are filled include these:
nuptime —Time elapsed since the system booted, in seconds
ntotalram —T otal available physical RAM
nfreeram —Free physical RAM
nprocs —Number of processes on the system
See the sysinfo man page for a full description of structsysinfo . Include
<linux/kernel.h> ,<linux/sys.h> , and <sys/sysinfo.h> if you use sysinfo .
The program in Listing 8.12 prints some statistics about the current system.Listing 8.11 Continued10 0430 Ch08  5/22/01  10:33 AM  Page 186

}
8.15 uname
The uname system call fills a structure with various system information, including the
computer ’s network name and domain name, and the operating system version it ’s
running. Pass uname a single argument, a pointer to a struct utsname object. Include
<sys/utsname.h> if you use uname .
The call to uname fills in these fields:
nsysname —The name of the operating system (such as Linux).
nrelease ,version —The Linux kernel release number and version level.
nmachine —Some information about the hardware platform running Linux. For
x86 Linux, this is i386 or i686, depending on the processor.
nnode—The computer ’s unqualified hostname.
n__domain —The computer ’s domain name.
Each of these fields is a character string.

Inline Assembly Code
9
T ODAY,FEW PROGRAMMERS USE ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE . Higher-level languages such
as C and C++ run on nearly all architectures and yield higher productivity whenwriting and maintaining code. For occasions when programmers need to use assemblyinstructions in their programs, the GNU Compiler Collection permits programmersto add architecture-dependent assembly language instructions to their programs.
GCC ’s inline assembly statements should not be used indiscriminately.Assembly
language instructions are architecture-dependent, so, for example, programs using x86instructions cannot be compiled on PowerPC computers.T o use them, you ’ll require a
facility in the assembly language for your architecture. However, inline assembly statements permit you to access hardware directly and can also yield faster code.
An 
asminstruction allows you to insert assembly instructions into C and C++ 
programs. For example, this instruction
asm (“fsin” : “=t” (answer) : “0” (angle));
is an x86-speci ﬁc way of coding this C statement:1
answer = sin (angle);
1.The expression sin (angle) is usually implemented as a function call into the math
library, but if you specify the -O1or higher optimization ﬂag, GCC is smart enough to replace
the function call with a single fsin assembly instruction.11 0430 CH09  5/22/01  10:36 AM  Page 189
190 Chapter 9 Inline Assembly Code
Observe that unlike ordinary assembly code instructions, asmstatements permit you to
specify input and output operands using C syntax.
T o read more about the x86 instruction set, which we will use in this 
chapter, see http://developer.intel.com/design/pentiumii/manuals/ and
http://www.x86-64.org/documentation .
9.1 When to Use Assembly Code
Although asmstatements can be abused, they allow your programs to access the 
computer hardware directly, and they can produce programs that execute quickly.Y ou can use them when writing operating system code that directly needs to interact with hardware. For example,
/usr/include/asm/io.h contains assembly
instructions to access input/output ports directly.The Linux source code ﬁle
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/process.s provides another example, using hltin
idle loop code. See other Linux source code ﬁles in /usr/src/linux/arch/ and
/usr/src/linux/drivers/ .
Assembly instructions can also speed the innermost loop of computer programs.
For example, if the majority of a program ’s running time is computing the sine and
cosine of the same angles, this innermost loop could be recoded using the fsincos
x86 instruction.2See, for example, /usr/include/bits/mathinline.h , which wraps 
up into macros some inline assembly sequences that speed transcendental functioncomputation.
Y ou should use inline assembly to speed up code only as a last resort. Current com-
pilers are quite sophisticated and know a lot about the details of the processors forwhich they generate code.Therefore, compilers can often choose code sequences thatmay seem unintuitive or roundabout but that actually execute faster than otherinstruction sequences. Unless you understand the instruction set and scheduling attrib-utes of your target processor very well, you ’re probably better off letting the compiler ’s
optimizers generate assembly code for you for most operations.
Occasionally, one or two assembly instructions can replace several lines of higher-
level language code. For example, determining the position of the most signi ﬁcant
nonzero bit of a nonzero integer using the C programming languages requires a loopor ﬂoating-point computations. Many architectures, including the x86, have a single
assembly instruction (
bsr) to compute this bit position.We ’ll demonstrate the use of
one of these in Section 9.4, “Example. ”

running time than using assembly instructions.11 0430 CH09  5/22/01  10:36 AM  Page 190

9.2 Simple Inline Assembly
Here we introduce the syntax of asmassembler instructions with an x86 example to
shift a value 8 bits to the right:
asm (“shrl $8, %0” : “=r” (answer) : “r” (operand) : “cc”);
The keyword asmis followed by a parenthetic expression consisting of sections sepa-
rated by colons.The ﬁrst section contains an assembler instruction and its operands. In
this example, shrl right-shifts the bits in its ﬁrst operand. Its ﬁrst operand is repre-
sented by %0. Its second operand is the immediate constant $8.
The second section speci ﬁes the outputs.The instruction ’s one output will be
placed in the C variable answer , which must be an lvalue.The string “=r” contains an
equals sign indicating an output operand and an rindicating that answer is stored in a
register.
The third section speci ﬁes the inputs.The C variable operand speciﬁes the value to
shift.The string “r”indicates that it is stored in a register but omits an equals sign
because it is an input operand, not an output operand.
The fourth section indicates that the instruction changes the value in the condition
code ccregister.
9.2.1 Converting an asmto Assembly Instructions
GCC ’s treatment of asmstatements is very simple. It produces assembly instructions to
deal with the asm’s operands, and it replaces the asmstatement with the instruction
that you specify. It does not analyze the instruction in any way.
For example, GCC converts this program fragment
double foo, bar;asm (“mycool_asm %1, %0” : “=r” (bar) : “r” (foo));
to these x86 assembly instructions:
movl -8(%ebp),%edxmovl -4(%ebp),%ecx
#APP
mycool_asm %edx, %edx
#NO_APP
movl %edx,-16(%ebp)movl %ecx,-12(%ebp)
Remember that fooand bareach require two words of stack storage on a 32-bit x86
architecture.The register ebppoints to data on the stack.
The ﬁrst two instructions copy foointo registers EDXand ECXon which mycool_asm
operates.The compiler decides to use the same registers to store the answer, which iscopied into 
barby the ﬁnal two instructions. It chooses appropriate registers, even
reusing the same registers, and copies operands to and from the proper locationsautomatically.11 0430 CH09  5/22/01  10:36 AM  Page 191

9.3 Extended Assembly Syntax
In the subsections that follow, we describe the syntax rules for asmstatements.Their
sections are separated by colons.
We will refer to this illustrative asmstatement, which computes the Boolean 
expression x > y :
asm (“fucomip %%st(1), %%st; seta %%al” :
“=a” (result) : “u” (y), “t” (x) : “cc”, “st”);
First,fucomip compares its two operands xand y, and stores values indicating the result
into the condition code register.Then seta converts these values into a 0 or 1 result.
9.3.1 Assembler Instructions
The ﬁrst section contains the assembler instructions, enclosed in quotation marks.The
example asmcontains two assembly instructions, fucomip and seta, separated by semi-
colons. If the assembler does not permit semicolons, use newline characters ( \n) to
separate instructions.
The compiler ignores the contents of this ﬁrst section, except that one level of 
percentage signs is removed, so %%changes to %.The meaning of %%st(1) and other
such terms is architecture-dependent.
GCC will complain if you specify the -traditional option or the -ansi option
when compiling a program containing asmstatements.T o avoid producing these
errors, such as in header ﬁles, use the alternative keyword __asm__ .
9.3.2 Outputs
The second section speci ﬁes the instructions ’output operands using C syntax. Each
operand is speci ﬁed by an operand constraint string followed by a C expression in
parentheses. For output operands, which must be lvalues, the constraint string shouldbegin with an equals sign.The compiler checks that the C expression for each outputoperand is in fact an lvalue.
Letters specifying registers for a particular architecture can be found in the 
GCC source code, in the 
REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER macro. For example, the 
gcc/conﬁg/i386/i386.h conﬁguration ﬁle in GCC lists the register letters for the x86
architecture.3Table 9.1 summarizes these.
3. Y ou ’ll need to have some familiarity with GCC ’s internals to make sense of this ﬁle.11 0430 CH09  5/22/01  10:36 AM  Page 192

Multiple operands in an asmstatement, each speci ﬁed by a constraint string and a C
expression, are separated by commas, as illustrated in the example asm’s input section.
Y ou may specify up to 10 operands, denoted %0,%1,…,%9, in the output and 
input sections. If there are no output operands but there are input operands or clobbered registers, leave the output section empty or mark it with a comment like 
/* no outputs */ .
9.3.3 Inputs
The third section speci ﬁes the input operands for the assembler instructions.The con-
straint string for an input operand should not have an equals sign, which indicates anlvalue. Otherwise, an input operand ’s syntax is the same as for output operands.
T o indicate that a register is both read from and written to in the same 
asm, use an
input constraint string of the output operand ’s number. For example, to indicate that
an input register is the same as the ﬁrst output register number, use 0. Output
operands are numbered left to right, starting with 0. Merely specifying the same Cexpression for an output operand and an input operand does not guarantee that thetwo values will be placed in the same register.
This input section can be omitted if there are no input operands and the subse-
quent clobber section is empty.11 0430 CH09  5/22/01  10:36 AM  Page 193
194 Chapter 9 Inline Assembly Code
9.3.4 Clobbers
If an instruction modi ﬁes the values of one or more registers as a side effect, specify
the clobbered registers in the asm’s fourth section. For example, the fucomip instruc-
tion modi ﬁes the condition code register, which is denoted cc. Separate strings repre-
senting clobbered registers with commas. If the instruction can modify an arbitrarymemory location, specify 
memory . Using the clobber information, the compiler deter-
mines which values must be reloaded after the asmexecutes. If you don ’t specify this
information correctly, GCC may assume incorrectly that registers still contain valuesthat have, in fact, been overwritten, which will affect your program ’s correctness.
9.4 Example
The x86 architecture includes instructions that determine the positions of the leastsigniﬁcant set bit and the most signi ﬁcant set bit in a word.The processor can execute
these instructions quite ef ﬁciently. In contrast, implementing the same operation in C
requires a loop and a bit shift.
For example, the 
bsrl assembly instruction computes the position of the most sig-
niﬁcant bit set in its ﬁrst operand, and places the bit position (counting from 0, the
least signi ﬁcant bit) into its second operand.T o place the bit position for number into
position , we could use this asmstatement:
asm (“bsrl %1, %0” : “=r” (position) : “r” (number));
One way you could implement the same operation in C is using this loop:
long i;for (i = (number >> 1), position = 0; i != 0; ++position)
i >>= 1;
T o test the relative speeds of these two versions, we ’ll place them in a loop that com-
putes the bit positions for a large number of values. Listing 9.1 does this using the Cloop implementation.The program loops over integers, from 1 up to the value speci-ﬁed on the command line. For each value of 
number , it computes the most signi ﬁcant
bit that is set. Listing 9.2 does the same thing using the inline assembly instruction.Note that in both versions, we assign the computed bit position to a volatile variable
result .This is to coerce the compiler ’s optimizer so that it does not eliminate the
entire bit position computation; if the result is not used or stored in memory, the opti-mizer eliminates the computation as “dead code. ”
Listing 9.1 (bit-pos-loop.c ) Find Bit Position Using a Loop
#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
long max = atoi (argv[1]);long number;11 0430 CH09  5/22/01  10:36 AM  Page 194
195 9.4 Example
long i;unsigned position;volatile unsigned result;/* Repeat the operation for a large number of values.  */for (number = 1; number <= max; ++number) {
/* Repeatedly shift the number to the right, until the result is
zero.  Keep count of the number of shifts this requires.  */
for (i = (number >> 1), position = 0; i != 0; ++position)
i >>= 1;
/* The position of the most signiﬁcant set bit is the number of
shifts we needed after the ﬁrst one.  */
result = position;
}return 0;
}
Listing 9.2 (bit-pos-asm.c ) Find Bit Position Using bsrl
#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
long max = atoi (argv[1]);long number;unsigned position;volatile unsigned result;/* Repeat the operation for a large number of values.  */for (number = 1; number <= max; ++number) {
/* Compute the position of the most signiﬁcant set bit using the
bsrl assembly instruction.  */
asm (“bsrl %1, %0” : “=r” (position) : “r” (number));result = position;
}return 0;
}
We’ll compile both versions with full optimization:
% cc -O2 -o bit-pos-loop bit-pos-loop.c% cc -O2 -o bit-pos-asm bit-pos-asm.c
Now let ’s run each using the time command to measure execution time.We ’ll specify
a large value as the command-line argument, to make sure that each version takes atleast a few seconds to run.11 0430 CH09  5/22/01  10:36 AM  Page 195

Notice that the version that uses inline assembly executes a great deal faster (yourresults for this example may vary).
9.5 Optimization Issues
GCC ’s optimizer attempts to rearrange and rewrite programs ’code to minimize exe-
cution time even in the presence of asmexpressions. If the optimizer determines that
an asm’s output values are not used, the instruction will be omitted unless the keyword
volatile occurs between asmand its arguments. (As a special case, GCC will not
move an asmwithout any output operands outside a loop.) Any asmcan be moved in
ways that are dif ﬁcult to predict, even across jumps.The only way to guarantee a par-
ticular assembly instruction ordering is to include all the instructions in the same asm.
Using asms can restrict the optimizer ’s effectiveness because the compiler does not
know the asms ’semantics. GCC is forced to make conservative guesses that may pre-
vent some optimizations. Caveat emptor!
9.6 Maintenance and Portability Issues
If you decide to use nonportable, architecture-dependent asmstatements, encapsulating
these statements within macros or functions can aid in maintenance and porting.Placing all these macros in one ﬁle and documenting them will ease porting to a dif-
ferent architecture, something that occurs with surprising frequency even for “throw-
away”programs.Thus, the programmer will need to rewrite only one ﬁle for the
different architecture.
For example, most 
asmstatements in the Linux source code are grouped into
/usr/src/linux/include/asm and /usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386 header ﬁles, and
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/ and /usr/src/linux/drivers/ source ﬁles.11 0430 CH09  5/22/01  10:36 AM  Page 196
Security
10
M UCH OF THE POWER OF A GNU/L INUX SYSTEM COMES FROM its support for
multiple users and for networking. Many people can use the system at once, and theycan connect to the system from remote locations. Unfortunately, with this powercomes risk, especially for systems connected to the Internet. Under some circum-stances, a remote “hacker ”can connect to the system and read, modify, or remove files
that are stored on the machine. Or, two users on the same machine can read, modify,or remove each other ’s files when they should not be allowed to do so.When this
happens, the system ’s security is said to have been compromised .
The Linux kernel provides a variety of facilities to ensure that these events do not
take place. But to avoid security breaches, ordinary applications must be careful as well.For example, imagine that you are developing accounting software.Although youmight want all users to be able to file expense reports with the system, you wouldn ’t
want all users to be able to approve those reports.Y ou might want users to be able to
view their own payroll information, but you certainly wouldn ’t want them to be able
to view everyone else ’s payroll information.Y ou might want managers to be able to
view the salaries of employees in their departments, but you wouldn ’t want them to
view the salaries of employees in other departments.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 197
198 Chapter 10 Security
T o enforce these kinds of controls, you have to be very careful. It ’s amazingly easy
to make a mistake that allows users to do something you didn ’t intend them to be able
to do.The best approach is to enlist the help of security experts. Still, every applicationdeveloper ought to understand the basics.
10.1 Users and Groups
Each Linux user is assigned a unique number, called a user ID , or UID. Of course,
when you log in, you use a username rather than a user ID.The system converts yourusername to a particular user ID, and from then on it ’s only the user ID that counts.
Y ou can actually have more than one username for the same user ID.As far as the
system is concerned, the user IDs, not the usernames, matter.There ’s no way to give
one username more power than another if they both correspond to the same user ID.
Y ou can control access to a file or other resource by associating it with a particular
user ID.Then only the user corresponding to that user ID can access the resource. Forexample, you can create a file that only you can read, or a directory in which only youcan create new files.That ’s good enough for many simple cases.
Sometimes, however, you want to share a resource among multiple users. For exam-
ple, if you ’re a manager, you might want to create a file that any manager can read but
that ordinary employees cannot. Linux doesn ’t allow you to associate multiple user IDs
with a file, so you can ’t just create a list of all the people to whom you want to give
access and attach them all to the file.
Y ou can, however, create a group. Each group is assigned a unique number, called a
group ID , or GID. Every group contains one or more user IDs.A single user ID can be
a member of lots of groups, but groups can ’t contain other groups; they can contain
only users. Like users, groups have names.Also like usernames, however, the groupnames don ’t really matter; the system always uses the group ID internally.
Continuing our example, you could create a 
managers group and put the user IDs
for all the managers in this group.Y ou could then create a file that can be read by any-one in the 
managers group but not by people who aren ’t in the group. In general, you
can associate only one group with a resource.There ’s no way to specify that users can
access a file only if they ’re in either group 7 or group 42, for example.
If you ’re curious to see what your user ID is and what groups you are in, you can
use the idcommand. For example, the output might look like this:
% iduid=501(mitchell) gid=501(mitchell) groups=501(mitchell),503(csl)
The first part shows you that the user ID for the user who ran the command was 501.The command also figures out what the corresponding username is and displays thatin parentheses.The command shows that user ID 501 is actually in two groups: group501 (called 
mitchell ) and group 503 (called csl).Y ou ’re probably wondering why
group 501 appears twice: once in the gidfield and once in the groups field.We ’ll
explain this later.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 198
199 10.2 Process User IDs and Process Group IDs
10.1.1 The Superuser
One user account is very special.1This user has user ID 0 and usually has the user-
name root. It is also sometimes referred to as the superuser account.The root user can
do just about anything: read any file, remove any file, add new users, turn off networkaccess, and so forth. Lots of special operations can be performed only by processesrunning with root privilege —that is, running as user 
root.
The trouble with this design is that a lot of programs need to be run by root
because a lot of programs need to perform one of these special operations. If any ofthese programs misbehaves, chaos can result.There ’s no effective way to contain a pro-
gram when it ’s run by 
root; it can do anything . Programs run by root must be written
very carefully.
10.2 Process User IDs and Process Group IDs
Until now, we ’ve talked about commands being executed by a particular user.That ’s
not quite accurate because the computer never really knows which user is using it. IfEve learns Alice ’s username and password, then Eve can log in as Alice, and the com-
puter will let Eve do everything that Alice can do.The system knows only which userID is in use, not which user is typing the commands. If Alice can ’t be trusted to keep
her password to herself, for example, then nothing you do as an application developerwill prevent Eve from accessing Alice ’s files.The responsibility for system security is
shared among the application developer, the users of the system, and the administratorsof the system.
Every process has an associated user ID and group ID.When you invoke a com-
mand, it typically runs in a process whose user and group IDs are the same as youruser and group IDs.When we say that a user performs an operation, we really meanthat a process with the corresponding user ID performs that operation.When theprocess makes a system call, the kernel decides whether to allow the operation to pro-ceed. It makes that determination by examining the permissions associated with theresources that the process is trying to access and by checking the user ID and groupID associated with the process trying to perform the action.
Now you know what that middle field printed by the 
idcommand is all about. It ’s
showing the group ID of the current process. Even though user 501 is in multiplegroups, the current process can have only one group ID. In the example shown previ-ously, the current group ID is 501.
If you have to manipulate user IDs and group IDs in your program (and you will, if
you’re writing programs that deal with security), then you should use the 
uid_t and
gid_t types defined in <sys/types.h> . Even though user IDs and group IDs are essen-
tially just integers, avoid making any assumptions about how many bits are used inthese types or perform arithmetic operations on them. Just treat them as opaque handles for user and group identity.
1.The fact that there is only one special user gave AT&T the name for its UNIX operating
system. In contrast, an earlier operating system that had multiple special users was calledMULTICS. GNU/Linux, of course, is mostly compatible with UNIX.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 199
200 Chapter 10 Security
T o get the user ID and group ID for the current process, you can use the geteuid
and getegid functions, declared in <unistd.h> .These functions don ’t take any parame-
ters, and they always work; you don ’t have to check for errors. Listing 10.1 shows a
simple program that provides a subset of the functionality provide by the idcommand:
Listing 10.1 (simpleid.c ) Print User and Group IDs
#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>#include <stdio.h>int main() {
uid_t uid = geteuid ();gid_t gid = getegid ();printf (“uid=%d gid=%d\n”, (int) uid, (int) gid);return 0;
}
When this program is run (by the same user who ran the real idprogram) the output
is as follows:
% ./simpleiduid=501 gid=501
10.3 File System Permissions
A good way to see users and groups in action is to look at file system permissions. Byexamining how the system associates permissions with each file and then seeing howthe kernel checks to see who is allowed to access which files, the concepts of user IDand group ID should become clearer.
Each file has exactly one owning user and exactly one owning group .When you create
a new file, the file is owned by the user and group of the creating process.
2
The basic things that you can do with files, as far as Linux is concerned, are read
from them, writeto them, and execute them. (Note that creating a file and removing a
file are not considered things you can do with the file; they ’re considered things you
can do with the directory containing the file.We ’ll get to this a little later.) If you can ’t
read a file, Linux won ’t let you examine the file ’s contents. If you can ’t write a file, you
can’t change its contents. If there ’s a program file for which you do not have execute
permission, you cannot run the program.
2.Actually, there are some rare exceptions, involving sticky bits , discussed later in Section
10.3.2, “Sticky Bits. ”12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 200
201 10.3 File System Permissions
Linux enables you to designate which of these three actions —reading, writing, and
executing —can be performed by the owning user, owning group, and everybody else.
For example, you could say that the owning user can do anything she wants with thefile, that anyone in the owning group can read and execute the file (but not write toit), and that nobody else can access the file at all.
Y ou can view these permission bits interactively with the 
lscommand by using the
-lor -ooptions and programmatically with the stat system call.Y ou can set the per-
mission bits interactively with the chmod program3or programmatically with the 
system call of the same name.T o look at the permissions on a file named hello , use 
ls -l hello . Here ’s how the output might look:
% ls -l hello-rwxr-x---    1 samuel   csl         11734 Jan 22 16:29 hello
The samuel and cslfields indicate that the owning user is samuel and that the owning
group is csl.
The string of characters at the beginning of the line indicates the permissions asso-
ciated with the file.The first dash indicates that this is a normal file. It would be dfor
a directory, or it can be other letters for special kinds of files such as devices (seeChapter 6, “Devices ”) or named pipes (see Chapter 5, “Interprocess Communication, ”
Section 5.4, “Pipes”).The next three characters show permissions for the owning user;
they indicate that 
samuel can read, write, and execute the file.The next three charac-
ters show permissions for members of the cslgroup; these members are allowed only
to read and execute the file.The last three characters show permissions for everyoneelse; these users are not allowed to do anything with 
hello .
Let’s see how this works. First, let ’s try to access the file as the user nobody , who is
not in the cslgroup:
% iduid=99(nobody) gid=99(nobody) groups=99(nobody)% cat hellocat: hello: Permission denied% echo hi > hellosh: ./hello: Permission denied% ./hellosh: ./hello: Permission denied
We can ’t read the file, which is why catfails; we can ’t write to the file, which is why
echo fails; and we can ’t run the file, which is why ./hello fails.
3.Y ou ’ll sometimes see the permission bits for a file referred to as the file ’s mode.The name
of the chmod command is short for “change mode. ”12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 201
202 Chapter 10 Security
Things are better if we are accessing the file as mitchell , who is a member of the
cslgroup:
% iduid=501(mitchell) gid=501(mitchell) groups=501(mitchell),503(csl)% cat hello#!/bin/bashecho “Hello, world.”% ./helloHello, world.% echo hi > hellobash: ./hello: Permission denied
We can list the contents of the file, and we can run it (it ’s a simple shell script), but we
still can ’t write to it.
If we run as the owner ( samuel ), we can even overwrite the file:
% iduid=502(samuel) gid=502(samuel) groups=502(samuel),503(csl)% echo hi > hello% cat hellohi
Y ou can change the permissions associated with a file only if you are the file ’s owner
(or the superuser). For example, if you now want to allow everyone to execute thefile, you can do this:
% chmod o+x hello% ls -l hello-rwxr-x--x    1 samuel   csl             3 Jan 22 16:38 hello
Note that there ’s now an xat the end of the first string of characters.The o+xbit
means that you want to add the execute permission for other people (not the file ’s
owner or members of its owning group).Y ou could use g-winstead, to remove the
write permission from the group. See the man page in section 1 for chmod for details
about this syntax:
% man 1 chmod
Programmatically, you can use the stat system call to find the permissions associated
with a file.This function takes two parameters: the name of the file you want to findout about, and the address of a data structure that is filled in with information aboutthe file. See Appendix B, “Low-Level I/O, ”Section B.2, “
stat,”for a discussion of other
information that you can obtain with stat. Listing 10.2 shows an example of using
stat to obtain file permissions.
Listing 10.2 (stat-perm.c ) Determine File Owner ’s Write Permission
#include <stdio.h>#include <sys/stat.h>int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
const char* const filename = argv[1];struct stat buf;12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 202
203 10.3 File System Permissions
/* Get file information.  */stat (filename, &buf);/* If the permissions are set such that the file’s owner can write
to it, print a message.  */
if (buf.st_mode & S_IWUSR)
printf (“Owning user can write `%s’.\n”, filename);
return 0;
}
If you run this program on our hello program, it says:
% ./stat-perm helloOwning user can write ‘hello’.
The S_IWUSR constant corresponds to write permission for the owning user.There are
other constants for all the other bits. For example, S_IRGRP is read permission for the
owning group, and S_IXOTH is execute permission for users who are neither the own-
ing user nor a member of the owning group. If you store permissions in a variable, usethe typedef 
mode_t for that variable. Like most system calls, stat will return -1and set
errno if it can ’t obtain information about the file.
Y ou can use the chmod function to change the permission bits on an existing file.
Y ou call chmod with the name of the file you want to change and the permission bits
you want set, presented as the bitwise or of the various permission constants men-tioned previously. For example, this next line would make 
hello readable and exe-
cutable by its owning user but would disable all other permissions associated with
hello:
chmod (“hello”, S_IRUSR |S_IXUSR);
The same permission bits apply to directories, but they have different meanings. If auser is allowed to read from a directory, the user is allowed to see the list of files thatare present in that directory. If a user is allowed to write to a directory, the user isallowed to add or remove files from the directory. Note that a user may remove filesfrom a directory if she is allowed to write to the directory, even if she does not have per-
mission to modify the file she is removing . If a user is allowed to execute a directory, the
user is allowed to enter that directory and access the files therein.Without executeaccess to a directory, a user is not allowed to access the files in that directory indepen-dent of the permissions on the files themselves.
T o summarize, let ’s review how the kernel decides whether to allow a process to
access a particular file. It checks to see whether the accessing user is the owning user, amember of the owning group, or someone else.The category into which the accessinguser falls is used to determine which set of read/write/execute bits are checked.Thenthe kernel checks the operation that is being performed against the permission bitsthat apply to this user.

4.The kernel may also deny access to a file if a component directory in its file path is inac-
cessible. For instance, if a process may not access the directory /tmp/private/ , it may not read
/tmp/private/data , even if the permissions on the latter are set to allow the access.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 203
204 Chapter 10 Security
There is one important exception: Processes running as root (those with user ID 0)
are always allowed to access any file, regardless of the permissions associated with it.
10.3.1 Security Hole: Programs Without Execute Permissions
Here’s a first example of where security gets very tricky.Y ou might think that if you
disallow execution of a program, then nobody can run it.After all, that ’s what it means
to disallow execution. But a malicious user can make a copy of the program, changethe permissions to make it executable, and then run the copy! If you rely on users notbeing able to run programs that aren ’t executable but then don ’t prevent them from
copying the programs, you have a security hole —a means by which users can perform
some action that you didn ’t intend.
10.3.2 Sticky Bits
In addition to read, write, and execute permissions, there is a magic bit called the sticky
bit.5This bit applies only to directories.
A directory that has the sticky bit set allows you to delete a file only if you are the
owner of the file.As mentioned previously, you can ordinarily delete a file if you havewrite access to the directory that contains it, even if you are not the file ’s owner.When
the sticky bit is set, you stillmust have write access to the directory, but you must also
be the owner of the file that you want to delete.
A few directories on the typical GNU/Linux system have the sticky bit set. For
example, the 
/tmp directory, in which any user can place temporary files, has the sticky
bit set.This directory is specifically designed to be used by all users, so the directorymust be writable by everyone. But it would be bad if one user could delete anotheruser’s files, so the sticky bit is set on the directory.Then only the owning user (or
root, of course) can remove a file.
Y ou can see the sticky bit is set because of the tat the end of the permission bits
when you run lson /tmp:
% ls -ld /tmpdrwxrwxrwt   12 root     root         2048 Jan 24 17:51 /tmp
The corresponding constant to use with stat and chmod is S_ISVTX .
If your program creates directories that behave like /tmp, in that lots of people put
things there but shouldn ’t be able to remove each other ’s files, then you should set the
sticky bit on the directory.Y ou can set the sticky bit on a directory with the chmod
command by invoking the following:
% chmod o+t directory
5.This name is anachronistic; it goes back to a time when setting the sticky bit caused a pro-
gram to be retained in main memory even when it was done executing.The pages allocated tothe program were “stuck”in memory.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 204
205 10.4 Real and Effective IDs
T o set the sticky bit programmatically, call chmod with the S_ISVTX mode flag. For
example, to set the sticky bit of the directory specified by dir_path to those of the
/tmp and give full read, write, and execute permissions to all users, use this call:
chmod (dir_path, S_IRWXU |S_IRWXG |S_IRWXO |S_ISVTX);
10.4 Real and Effective IDs
Until now, we’ve talked about the user ID and group ID associated with a process as ifthere were only one such user ID and one such group ID. But, actually, it’s not quitethat simple.
Every process really has two user IDs: the effective user ID and the real user ID . (Of
course, there’s also an effective group ID and real group ID . Just about everything that’s
true about user IDs is also true about group IDs.) Most of the time, the kernel checksonly the effective user ID. For example, if a process tries to open a file, the kernelchecks the effective user ID when deciding whether to let the process access the file.
The 
geteuid and getegid functions described previously return the effective user
ID and the effective group ID. Corresponding getuid and getgid functions return the
real user ID and real group ID.
If the kernel cares about only the effective user ID, it doesn’t seem like there’s
much point in having a distinction between a real user ID and an effective user ID.However, there is one very important case in which the real user ID matters. If youwant to change the effective user ID of an already running process, the kernel looks atthe real user ID as well as the effective user ID.
Before looking at howyou can change the effective user ID of a process, let’s exam-
ine whyyou would want to do such a thing by looking back at our accounting pack-
age. Suppose that there’s a server process that might need to look at any file on thesystem, regardless of the user who created it. Such a process must run as 
root because
only root can be guaranteed to be capable of looking at any file. But now suppose
that a request comes in from a particular user (say, mitchell ) to access some file.The
server process could carefully examine the permissions associated with the files inquestion and try to decide whether 
mitchell should be allowed to access those files.
But that would mean duplicating all the processing that the kernel would normally doto check file access permissions. Reimplementing that logic would be complex, error-prone, and tedious.
A better approach is simply to temporarily change the effective user ID of the
process from 
root to mitchell and then try to perform the operations required. If
mitchell is not allowed to access the data, the kernel will prevent the process from
doing so and will return appropriate indications of error.After all the operations takenon behalf of 
mitchell are complete, the process can restore its original effective user
ID to root.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  2:38 PM  Page 205
206 Chapter 10 Security
Programs that authenticate users when they log in take advantage of the capability
to change user IDs as well.These login programs run as root.When the user enters a
username and password, the login program verifies the username and password in thesystem password database.Then the login program changes both the effective user IDand the real ID to be that of the user. Finally, the login program calls 
exec to start the
user’s shell, leaving the user running a shell whose effective user ID and real user ID
are that of the user.
The function used to change the user IDs for a process is setreuid . (There is, of
course, a corresponding setregid function as well.) This function takes two argu-
ments.The first argument is the desired real user ID; the second is the desired effectiveuser ID. For example, here ’s how you would exchange the effective and real user IDs:
setreuid (geteuid(), getuid ());
Obviously, the kernel won ’t let just any process change its user IDs. If a process were
allowed to change its effective user ID at will, then any user could easily impersonateany other user, simply by changing the effective user ID of one of his processes.Thekernel will let a process running with an effective user ID of 0 change its user IDs asit sees fit. (Again, notice how much power a process running as 
root has! A process
whose effective user ID is 0 can do absolutely anything it pleases.) Any other process,however, can do only one of the following things:
nSet its effective user ID to be the same as its real user ID
nSet its real user ID to be the same as its effective user ID
nSwap the two user IDs
The first alternative would be used by our accounting process when it has finishedaccessing files as 
mitchell and wants to return to being root.The second alternative
could be used by a login program after it has set the effective user ID to that of theuser who just logged in. Setting the real user ID ensures that the user will never beable go back to being 
root. Swapping the two user IDs is almost a historical artifact;
modern programs rarely use this functionality.
Y ou can pass -1 to either argument to setreuid if you want to leave that user ID
alone.There ’s also a convenience function called seteuid .This function sets the effec-
tive user ID, but it doesn ’t modify the real user ID.The following two statements both
do exactly the same thing:
seteuid (id);setreuid (-1, id);
10.4.1 Setuid Programs
Using the previous techniques, you know how to make a root process impersonate
another process temporarily and then return to being root.Y ou also know how to
make a root process drop all its special privileges by setting both its real user ID and
its effective user ID.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 206
207 10.4 Real and Effective IDs
Here’s a puzzle: Can you, running as a non- root user, ever become root? That
doesn ’t seem possible, using the previous techniques, but here ’s proof that it can be
done:
% whoamimitchell% suPassword: ...% whoamiroot
The whoami command is just like id, except that it shows only the effective user ID,
not all the other information.The sucommand enables you to become the superuser
if you know the root password.
How does suwork? Because we know that the shell was originally running with
both its real user ID and its effective user ID set to mitchell ,setreuid won’t allow us
to change either user ID.
The trick is that the suprogram is a setuid program.That means that when it is
run, the effective user ID of the process will be that of the file ’s owner rather than the
effective user ID of the process that performed the exec call. (The real user ID will
still be that of the executing user.) T o create a setuid program, you use chmod +s at the
command line, or use the S_ISUID flag if calling chmod programmatically.6
For example, consider the program in Listing 10.3.
Listing 10.3 (setuid-test.c ) Setuid Demonstration Program
#include <stdio.h>#include <unistd.h>int main () {
printf (“uid=%d euid=%d\n”, (int) getuid (), (int) geteuid ());return 0;
}
Now suppose that this program is setuid and owned by root. In that case, the lsout-
put will look like this:
-rwsrws--x    1 root     root        11931 Jan 24 18:25 setuid-test
The sbits indicate that the file is not only executable (as an xbit would indicate) but
also setuid and setgid.When we use this program, we get output like this:
% whoamimitchell% ./setuid-test uid=501 euid=0
6. Of course, there is a similar notion of a setgid program.When run, its effective group 
ID is the same as that of the group owner of the file. Most setuid programs are also setgid programs.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 207
208 Chapter 10 Security
Note that the effective user ID is set to 0 when the program is run.
Y ou can use the chmod command with the u+sor g+sarguments to set the setuid
and setgid bits on an executable file, respectively —for example:
% ls -l program-rwxr-xr-x    1 samuel   csl             0 Jan 30 23:38 program% chmod g+s program% ls -l program-rwxr-sr-x    1 samuel   csl             0 Jan 30 23:38 program% chmod u+s program% ls -l program-rwsr-sr-x    1 samuel   csl             0 Jan 30 23:38 program
Y ou can also use the chmod call with the S_ISUID or S_ISGID mode flags.
suis capable of changing the effective user ID through this mechanism. It runs 
initially with an effective user ID of 0.Then it prompts you for a password. If the password matches the 
root password, it sets its real user ID to be root as well and 
then starts a new shell. Otherwise, it exits, unceremoniously leaving you as a non-privileged user.
Take a look at the permissions on the 
suprogram:
% ls -l /bin/su-rwsr-xr-x    1 root     root        14188 Mar  7  2000 /bin/su
Notice that it ’s owned by root and that the setuid bit is set.
Note that sudoesn ’t actually change the user ID of the shell from which it was
run. Instead, it starts a new shell process with the new user ID.The original shell isblocked until the new shell completes and 
suexits.
10.5 Authenticating Users
Often, if you have a setuid program, you don ’t want to offer its services to everyone.
For example, the suprogram lets you become root only if you know the root pass-
word.The program makes you prove that you are entitled to become root before
going ahead with its actions.This process is called authentication —the suprogram is
checking to see that you are authentic.
If you ’re administering a very secure system, you probably don ’t want to let people
log in just by typing an ordinary password. Users tend to write down passwords, andblack hats tend to find them. Users tend to pick passwords that involve their birthdays,the names of their pets, and so forth.
7Passwords just aren ’t all that secure.
7. It has been found that system administrators tend to pick the word godas their password
more often than any other password. (Make of that what you will.) So, if you ever need root
access on a machine and the sysadmin isn ’t around, a little divine inspiration might be just what
you need.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 208
209 10.5 Authenticating Users
For example, many organizations now require the use of special “one-time ”pass-
words that are generated by special electronic ID cards that users keep with them.Thesame password can ’t be used twice, and you can ’t get a valid password out of the ID
card without entering a PIN. So, an attacker must obtain both the physical card andthe PIN to break in. In a really secure facility, retinal scans or other kinds of biometrictesting are used.
If you ’re writing a program that must perform authentication, you should allow the
system administrator to use whatever means of authentication is appropriate for thatinstallation. GNU/Linux comes with a very useful library that makes this very easy.This facility, called Pluggable Authentication Modules , or PAM, makes it easy to write
applications that authenticate their users as the system administrator sees fit.
It’s easiest to see how PAM works by looking at a simple PAM application. Listing
10.4 illustrates the use of PAM.
Listing 10.4 (pam.c) PAM Example
#include <security/pam_appl.h>#include <security/pam_misc.h>#include <stdio.h>int main () {
pam_handle_t* pamh;struct pam_conv pamc;/* Set up the PAM conversation.  */pamc.conv = &misc_conv;pamc.appdata_ptr = NULL;/* Start a new authentication session.  */pam_start (“su”, getenv (“USER”), &pamc, &pamh);/* Authenticate the user.  */if (pam_authenticate (pamh, 0) != PAM_SUCCESS)
fprintf (stderr, “Authentication failed!\n”);
else
fprintf (stderr, “Authentication OK.\n”);
/* All done.  */pam_end (pamh, 0);return 0;
}
T o compile this program, you have to link it with two libraries: the libpam library and
a helper library called libpam_misc :
% gcc -o pam pam.c -lpam -lpam_misc12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 209
210 Chapter 10 Security
This program starts off by building up a PAM conversation object .This object is used 
by the PAM library whenever it needs to prompt the user for information.The
misc_conv function used in this example is a standard conversation function that uses
the terminal for input and output.Y ou could write your own function that pops up adialog box, or that uses speech for input and output, or that provides even more exoticinput and output methods.
The program then calls 
pam_start .This function initializes the PAM library.The first
argument is a service name.Y ou should use a name that uniquely identifies your appli-cation. For example, if your application is named whizbang, you should probably usethat for the service name, too. However, the program probably won ’t work until the
system administrator explicitly configures the system to work with your service. So, inthis example, we use the su service, which says that our program should authenticateusers in the same way that the 
sucommand does.Y ou should notuse this technique in a
real program. Pick a real service name, and have your installation scripts help the systemadministrator to set up a correct PAM configuration for your application.
The second argument is the name of the user whom you want to authenticate. In
this example, we use the value of the 
USER environment variable. (Normally, this is the
username that corresponds to the effective user ID of the current process, but that ’s
not always the case.) In most real programs, you would prompt for a username at thispoint.The third argument indicates the PAM conversation, discussed previously.Thecall to 
pam_start fills in the handle provided as the fourth argument. Pass this handle
to subsequent calls to PAM library routines.
Next, the program calls pam_authenticate .The second argument enables you to
pass various flags; the value 0 means to use the default options.The return value fromthis function indicates whether authentication succeeded.
Finally, the programs calls 
pam_end to clean up any allocated data structures.
Let’s assume that the valid password for the current user is “password ”(an excep-
tionally poor password).Then, running this program with the correct password pro-duces the expected:
% ./pamPassword: passwordAuthentication OK.
If you run this program in a terminal, the password probably won ’t actually appear
when you type it in; it ’s hidden to prevent others from peeking at your password over
your shoulder as you type.
However, if a hacker tries to use the wrong password, the PAM library will cor-
rectly indicate failure:
% ./pamPassword: badguessAuthentication failed!12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 210
211 10.6 More Security Holes
The basics covered here are enough for most simple programs. Full documentationabout how PAM works is available in 
/usr/doc/pam on most GNU/Linux systems.
10.6 More Security Holes
Although this chapter will point out a few common security holes, you should by nomeans rely on this book to cover all possible security holes.A great many have alreadybeen discovered, and many more are out there waiting to be found. If you are tryingto write secure code, there is really no substitute for having a security expert audityour code.
10.6.1 Buffer Overruns
Almost every major Internet application daemon, including the sendmail daemon, the
finger daemon, the talk daemon, and others, has at one point been compromised
through a buffer overrun .
If you are writing any code that will ever be run as root, you absolutely must be
aware of this particular kind of security hole. If you are writing a program that per-forms any kind of interprocess communication, you should definitely be aware of thiskind of security hole. If you are writing a program that reads files (or might read files)
that are not owned by the user executing the program, you should be aware of this kind of security hole.That last criterion applies to almost every program.Fundamentally, if you ’re going to write GNU/Linux software, you ought to know
about buffer overruns.
The idea behind a buffer overrun attack is to trick a program into executing code
that it did not intend to execute.The usual mechanism for achieving this feat is tooverwrite some portion of the program ’s process stack.The program ’s stack contains,
among other things, the memory location to which the program will transfer controlwhen the current function returns.Therefore, if you can put the code that you wantto have executed into memory somewhere and then change the return address topoint to that piece of memory, you can cause the program to execute anything.Whenthe program returns from the function it is executing, it will jump to the new codeand execute whatever is there, running with the privileges of the current process.Clearly, if the current process is running as 
root, this would be a disaster. If the process
is running as another user, it ’s a disaster “only”for that user —and anybody else who
depends on the contents of files owned by that user, and so forth.
If the program is running as a daemon and listening for incoming network connec-
tions, the situation is even worse.A daemon typically runs as root. If it contains buffer
overrun bugs, anyone who can connect via the network to a computer running thedaemon can seize control of the computer by sending a malignant sequence of data tothe daemon over the network.A program that does not engage in network communi-cations is much safer because only users who are already able to log in to the com-puter running the program are able to attack it.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 211
212 Chapter 10 Security
The buggy versions of finger ,talk, and sendmail all shared a common flaw. Each
used a fixed-length string buffer, which implied a constant upper limit on the size ofthe string but then allowed network clients to provide strings that overflowed thebuffer. For example, they contained code similar to this:
#include <stdio.h>int main (){
/* Nobody in their right mind would have more than 32 characters in
their username.  Plus, I think UNIX allows only 8-characterusernames.  So, this should be plenty of space.  */
char username[32];/* Prompt the user for the username.  */printf (“Enter your username: “);/* Read a line of input.  */gets (username);/* Do other things here...  */return 0;
}
The combination of the 32-character buffer with the gets function permits a buffer
overrun.The gets function reads user input up until the next newline character and
stores the entire result in the username buffer.The comments in the code are correct
in that people generally have short usernames, so no well-meaning user is likely totype in more than 32 characters. But when you ’re writing secure software, you must
consider what a malicious attacker might do. In this case, the attacker might deliber-ately type in a very long username. Local variables such as 
username are stored on the
stack, so by exceeding the array bounds, it ’s possible to put arbitrary bytes onto the
stack beyond the area reserved for the username variable.The username will overrun
the buffer and overwrite parts of the surrounding stack, allowing the kind of attackdescribed previously.
Fortunately, it ’s relatively easy to prevent buffer overruns.When reading strings, you
should always use a function, such as 
getline , that either dynamically allocates a suffi-
ciently large buffer or stops reading input if the buffer is full. For example, you coulduse this:
char* username = getline (NULL, 0, stdin);
This call automatically uses malloc to allocate a buffer big enough to hold the line and
returns it to you.Y ou have to remember to call free to deallocate the buffer, of course,
to avoid leaking memory.
Y our life will be even easier if you use C++ or another language that provides 
simple primitives for reading input. In C++, for example, you can simply use this:
string username;getline (cin, username);12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 212
213 10.6 More Security Holes
The username string will automatically be deallocated as well; you don ’t have to
remember to free it.8
Of course, buffer overruns can occur with any statically sized array, not just with
strings. If you want to write secure code, you should never write into a data structure,on the stack or elsewhere, without verifying that you ’re not going to write beyond its
region of memory.
10.6.2 Race Conditions in /tmp
Another very common problem involves the creation of files with predictable names,typically in the 
/tmp directory. Suppose that your program prog, running as root,
always creates a temporary file called /tmp/prog and writes some vital information
there.A malicious user can create a symbolic link from /tmp/prog to any other file on
the system.When your program goes to create the file, the open system call will suc-
ceed. However, the data that you write will not go to /tmp/prog ; instead, it will be
written to some arbitrary file of the attacker ’s choosing.
This kind of attack is said to exploit a race condition .There is implicitly a race
between you and the attacker.Whoever manages to create the file first wins.
This attack is often used to destroy important parts of the file system. By creating
the appropriate links, the attacker can trick a program running as root that is supposed
to write a temporary file into overwriting an important system file instead. For exam-ple, by making a symbolic link to 
/etc/passwd , the attacker can wipe out the system ’s
password database.There are also ways in which a malicious user can obtain root
access using this technique.
One attempt at avoiding this attack is to use a randomized name for the file. For
example, you could read from /dev/random to get some bits to use in the name of the
file.This certainly makes it harder for a malicious user to guess the filename, but itdoesn ’t make it impossible.The attacker might just create a large number of symbolic
links, using many potential names. Even if she has to try 10,000 times before winingthe race condition, that one time could be disastrous.
Another approach is to use the 
O_EXCL flag when calling open.This flag causes open
to fail if the file already exists. Unfortunately, if you ’re using the Network File System
(NFS), or if anyone who ’s using your program might ever be using NFS, that ’s not a
sufficiently robust approach because O_EXCL is not reliable when NFS is in use.Y ou
can’t ever really know for sure whether your code will be used on a system that uses
NFS, so if you ’re highly paranoid, don ’t rely on using O_EXCL .
In Chapter 2, “Writing Good GNU/Linux Software, ”Section 2.1.7, “Using
T emporary Files, ”we showed how to use mkstemp to create temporary files.
Unfortunately, what mkstemp does on Linux is open the file with O_EXCL after trying to
pick a name that is hard to guess. In other words, using mkstemp is still insecure if /tmp
is mounted over NFS.9So, using mkstemp is better than nothing, but it ’s not fully secure.
8. Some programmers believe that C++ is a horrible and overly complex language.Their
arguments about multiple inheritance and other such complications have some merit, but it iseasier to write code that avoids buffer overruns and other similar problems in C++ than in C.
9. Obviously, if you ’re also a system administrator, you shouldn ’t mount 
/tmp over NFS.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 213
214 Chapter 10 Security
One approach that works is to call lstat on the newly created file (lstat is discussed in
Section B.2, “stat”).The lstat function is like stat, except that if the file referred to
is a symbolic link, lstat tells you about the link, not the file to which it refers. If
lstat tells you that your new file is an ordinary file, not a symbolic link, and that it is
owned by you, then you should be okay.
Listing 10.5 presents a function that tries to securely open a file in /tmp.The authors
of this book have not had it audited professionally, nor are we professional securityexperts, so there ’s a good chance that it has a weakness, too.We do not recommend that
you use this code without getting an audit, but it should at least convince you thatwriting secure code is tricky.T o help dissuade you, we ’ve deliberately made the inter-
face difficult to use in real programs. Error checking is an important part of writingsecure software, so we ’ve included error-checking logic in this example.

This function calls open to create the file and then calls lstat a few lines later to make
sure that the file is not a symbolic link. If you ’re thinking carefully, you ’ll realize that
there seems to be a race condition at this point. In particular, an attacker could removethe file and replace it with a symbolic link between the time we call 
open and the12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 215
216 Chapter 10 Security
time we call lstat .That won ’t harm us directly because we already have an open file
descriptor to the newly created file, but it will cause us to indicate an error to ourcaller.This attack doesn ’t create any direct harm, but it does make it impossible for our
program to get its work done. Such an attack is called a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
Fortunately, the sticky bit comes to the rescue. Because the sticky bit is set on 
/tmp,
nobody else can remove files from that directory. Of course, root can still remove files
from /tmp, but if the attacker has root privilege, there ’s nothing you can do to protect
your program.
If you choose to assume competent system administration, then /tmp will not be
mounted via NFS.And if the system administrator was foolish enough to mount /tmp
over NFS, then there ’s a good chance that the sticky bit isn ’t set, either. So, for most
practical purposes, we think it ’s safe to use mkstemp . But you should be aware of these
issues, and you should definitely not rely on O_EXCL to work correctly if the directory
in use is not /tmp—nor you should rely on the sticky bit being set anywhere else.
10.6.3 Using system or popen
The third common security hole that every programmer should bear in mind involvesusing the shell to execute other programs.As a toy example, let ’s consider a dictionary
server.This program is designed to accept connections via the Internet. Each clientsends a word, and the server tells it whether that is a valid English word. Because every GNU/Linux system comes with a list of about 45,000 English words in
/usr/dict/words , an easy way to build this server is to invoke the grep program,
like this:
% grep -x word/usr/dict/words
Here,word is the word that the user is curious about.The exit code from grep will tell
you whether that word appears in /usr/dict/words .10
Listing 10.6 shows how you might try to code the part of the server that 
invokes grep:
Listing 10.6 (grep-dictionary.c ) Search for a Word in the Dictionary
#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>/* Returns a nonzero value if and only if the WORD appears in
/usr/dict/words.  */
int grep_for_word (const char* word) {
size_t length;char* buffer;int exit_code;
10. If you don ’t know about grep, you should look at the manual pages. It ’s an incredibly
useful program.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 216
217 10.6 More Security Holes
/* Build up the string ‘grep -x WORD /usr/dict/words’.  Allocate the
string dynamically to avoid buffer overruns.  */
length = 
strlen (“grep -x “) + strlen (word) + strlen (“ /usr/dict/words”) + 1;
buffer = (char*) malloc (length);sprintf (buffer, “grep -x %s /usr/dict/words”, word);/* Run the command.  */exit_code = system (buffer);/* Free the buffer.  */free (buffer);/* If grep returned 0, then the word was present in the
dictionary.  */
return exit_code == 0;
}
Note that by calculating the number of characters we need and then allocating thebuffer dynamically, we ’re sure to be safe from buffer overruns.
Unfortunately, the use of the 
system function (described in Chapter 3, “Processes, ”
Section 3.2.1, “Using system ”) is unsafe.This function invokes the standard system
shell to run the command and then returns the exit value. But what happens if a mali-cious hacker sends a “word”that is actually the following line or a similar string?
foo /dev/null; rm -rf /
In that case, the server will execute this command:
grep -x foo /dev/null; rm -rf / /usr/dict/words
Now the problem is obvious.The user has turned one command, ostensibly the invo-cation of 
grep, into two commands because the shell treats a semicolon as a command
separator.The first command is still a harmless invocation of grep, but the second
removes all files on the entire system! Even if the server is not running as root, all the
files that can be removed by the user running the server will be removed.The sameproblem can arise with 
popen (described in Section 5.4.4, “popen and pclose ”), which
creates a pipe between the parent and child process but still uses the shell to run thecommand.
There are two ways to avoid these problems. One is to use the 
exec family of func-
tions instead of system or popen .That solution avoids the problem because characters
that the shell treats specially (such as the semicolon in the previous command) are nottreated specially when they appear in the argument list to an 
exec call. Of course, you
give up the convenience of system and popen .12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 217
218 Chapter 10 Security
The other alternative is to validate the string to make sure that it is benign. In the
dictionary server example, you would make sure that the word provided contains onlyalphabetic characters, using the 
isalpha function. If it doesn ’t contain any other char-
acters, there ’s no way to trick the shell into executing a second command. Don ’t
implement the check by looking for dangerous and unexpected characters; it ’s always
safer to explicitly check for the characters that you know are safe rather than try toanticipate all the characters that might cause trouble.12 0430 CH10  5/22/01  10:42 AM  Page 218
A Sample GNU/Linux
Application
11
THIS CHAPTER IS WHERE IT ALL COMES TOGETHER .WE’LL DESCRIBE and implement a
complete GNU/Linux program that incorporates many of the techniques described inthis book.The program provides information about the system it ’s running on via a
Web interface.
The program is a complete demonstration of some of the methods we ’ve described
for GNU/Linux programming and illustrated in shorter programs.This program iswritten more like “real-world ”code, unlike most of the code listings that we presented
in previous chapters. It can serve as a jumping-off point for your own GNU/Linuxprograms.
11.1 Overview
The example program is part of a system for monitoring a running GNU/Linux system. It includes these features:
nThe program incorporates a minimal Web server. Local or remote clients accesssystem information by requesting Web pages from the server via HTTP .
nThe program does not serve static HTML pages. Instead, the pages are generatedon the fly by modules, each of which provides a page summarizing one aspect ofthe system ’s state.13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 219
220 Chapter 11 A Sample GNU/Linux Application
nModules are not linked statically into the server executable. Instead, they areloaded dynamically from shared libraries. Modules can be added, removed, orreplaced while the server is running.
nThe server services each connection in a child process.This enables the server toremain responsive even when individual requests take a while to complete, andit shields the server from failures in modules.
nThe server does not require superuser privilege to run (as long as it is not runon a privileged port). However, this limits the system information that it cancollect.
We provide four sample modules that demonstrate how modules might be written.They further illustrate some of the techniques for gathering system information pre-sented previously in this book.The 
time module demonstrates using the gettimeofday
system call.The issue module demonstrates low-level I/O and the sendfile system
call.The diskfree module demonstrates the use of fork,exec, and dup2 by running a
command in a child process.The processes module demonstrates the use of the /proc
file system and various system calls.
11.1.1 Caveats
This program has many of the features you ’d expect in an application program, such as
command-line parsing and error checking.At the same time, we ’ve made some simpli-
fications to improve readability and to focus on the GNU/Linux-specific topics dis-cussed in this book. Bear in mind these caveats as you examine the code.
nWe don ’t attempt to provide a full implementation of HTTP . Instead, we 
implement just enough for the server to interact with Web clients.A real-worldprogram either would provide a more complete HTTP implementation orwould interface with one of the various excellent Web server implementations
1
available instead of providing HTTP services directly.
nSimilarly, we don ’t aim for full compliance with HTML specifications (see
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/ ).We generate simple HTML output that can be
handled by popular Web browsers.
nThe server is not tuned for high performance or minimum resource usage. Inparticular, we intentionally omit some of the network configuration code thatyou would expect in a Web server.This topic is outside the scope of this book.See one of the many excellent references on network application development,such as UNIX Network Programming,Volume 1: Networking APIs —Sockets and XTI,
by W . Richard Stevens (Prentice Hall, 1997), for more information.
1.The most popular open source Web server for GNU/Linux is the Apache server, available
from http://www.apache.org .13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 220
221 11.2 Implementation
nWe make no attempt to regulate the resources (number of processes, memoryuse, and so on) consumed by the server or its modules. Many multiprocess Webserver implementations service connections using a fixed pool of processes ratherthan creating a new child process for each connection.
nThe server loads the shared library for a server module each time it is requestedand then immediately unloads it when the request has been completed.A moreefficient implementation would probably cache loaded modules.
HTTP
The Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP ) is used for communication between Web clients and servers. The
client connects to the server by establishing a connection to a well-known port (usually port 80 forInternet Web servers, but any port may be used). HTTP requests and headers are composed of plain text.Once connected, the client sends a request to the server. A typical request is 
GET /page HTTP/1.0 .
The GET method indicates that the client is requesting that the server send it a Web page. The secondelement is the path to that page on the server. The third element is the protocol and version. Subsequentlines contain header fields, formatted similarly to email headers, which contain extra information aboutthe client. The header ends with a blank line.The server sends back a response indicating the result of processing the request. A typical response is
HTTP/1.0 200 OK . The first element is the protocol version. The next two elements indicate the
result; in this case, result 200 indicates that the request was processed successfully. Subsequent lines
contain header fields, formatted similarly to email headers. The header ends with a blank line. The servermay then send arbitrary data to satisfy the request.Typically, the server responds to a page request by sending back HTML source for the Web page. In thiscase, the response headers will include 
Content-type: text/html , indicating that the result is
HTML source. The HTML source follows immediately after the header.See the HTTP specification at 
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/ for more information.
11.2 Implementation
All but the very smallest programs written in C require careful organization to pre-serve the modularity and maintainability of the source code.This program is dividedinto four main source files.
Each source file exports functions or variables that may be accessed by the other
parts of the program. For simplicity, all exported functions and variables are declared ina single header file,
server.h (see Listing 11.1), which is included by the other files.
Functions that are intended for use within a single compilation unit only are declared
static and are not declared in server.h .13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 221

/* We want to trim the name of the executable file, to obtain the

||last_slash == link_target)
/* Something strange is going on.  */abort ();
/* Allocate a buffer to hold the resulting path.  */result_length = last_slash - link_target;result = (char*) xmalloc (result_length + 1);/* Copy the result.  */strncpy (result, link_target, result_length);result[result_length] = ‘\0’;return result;
}
Y ou could use these functions in other programs as well; the contents of this file mightbe included in a common code library that is shared among many projects:
nxmalloc ,xrealloc , and xstrdup are error-checking versions of the C library
functions malloc ,realloc , and strdup , respectively. Unlike the standard versions,
which return a null pointer if the allocation fails, these functions immediatelyabort the program when insufficient memory is available.Early detection of memory allocation failure is a good idea. Otherwise, failedallocations introduce null pointers at unexpected places into the program.Because allocation failures are not easy to reproduce, debugging such problemscan be difficult.Allocation failures are usually catastrophic, so aborting the pro-gram is often an acceptable course of action.
nThe error function is for reporting a fatal program error. It prints a message to
stderr and ends the program. For errors caused by failed system calls or library
calls,system_error generates part of the error message from the value of errno
(see Section 2.2.3, “Error Codes from System Calls, ”in Chapter 2, “Writing
Good GNU/Linux Software ”).
nget_self_executable_directory determines the directory containing the exe-
cutable file being run in the current process.The directory path can be used tolocate other components of the program, which are installed in the same placeat runtime.This function works by examining the symbolic link 
/proc/self/exe
in the /proc file system (see Section 7.2.1, “/proc/self ,”in Chapter 7, “The
/proc File System ”).
In addition, common.c defines two useful global variables:
nThe value of program_name is the name of the program being run, as specified in
its argument list (see Section 2.1.1, “The Argument List, ”in Chapter 2).When
the program is invoked from the shell, this is the path and name of the programas the user entered it.13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 225
226 Chapter 11 A Sample GNU/Linux Application
nThe variable verbose is nonzero if the program is running in verbose mode. In
this case, various parts of the program print progress messages to stdout .
11.2.2 Loading Server Modules
module.c (see Listing 11.3) provides the implementation of dynamically loadable
server modules.A loaded server module is represented by an instance of 
struct server_module , which is defined in server.h .
Listing 11.3 (module.c ) Server Module Loading and Unloading
#include <dlfcn.h>#include <stdlib.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>#include “server.h”char* module_dir;struct server_module* module_open (const char* module_name){
char* module_path;void* handle;void (* module_generate) (int);struct server_module* module;/* Construct the full path of the module shared library we’ll try to
load.  */
module_path = 
(char*) xmalloc (strlen (module_dir) + strlen (module_name) + 2);
sprintf (module_path, “%s/%s”, module_dir, module_name);/* Attempt to open MODULE_PATH as a shared library.  */handle = dlopen (module_path, RTLD_NOW);free (module_path);if (handle == NULL) {
/* Failed; either this path doesn’t exist or it isn’t a shared
library.  */
return NULL;
}/* Resolve the module_generate symbol from the shared library.  */module_generate = (void (*) (int)) dlsym (handle, “module_generate”);/* Make sure the symbol was found.  */if (module_generate == NULL) {13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 226
227 11.2 Implementation
/* The symbol is missing.  While this is a shared library, it
probably isn’t a server module.  Close up and indicate failure.  */
dlclose (handle);return NULL;
}/* Allocate and initialize a server_module object.  */module = (struct server_module*) xmalloc (sizeof (struct server_module));module->handle = handle;module->name = xstrdup (module_name);module->generate_function = module_generate;/* Return it, indicating success.  */return module;
}void module_close (struct server_module* module){
/* Close the shared library.  */dlclose (module->handle);/* Deallocate the module name.  */free ((char*) module->name);/* Deallocate the module object.  */free (module);
}
Each module is a shared library file (see Section 2.3.2, “Shared Libraries, ”in Chapter
2) and must define and export a function named module_generate .This function gen-
erates an HTML Web page and writes it to the client socket file descriptor passed asits argument.
module.c contains two functions:
nmodule_open attempts to load a server module with a given name.The name
normally ends with the .soextension because server modules are implemented
as shared libraries.This function opens the shared library with dlopen and
resolves a symbol named module_generate from the library with dlsym (see
Section 2.3.6, “Dynamic Loading and Unloading, ”in Chapter 2). If the library
can’t be opened, or if module_generate isn’t a name exported by the library, the
call fails and module_open returns a null pointer. Otherwise, it allocates and
returns a module object.
nmodule_close closes the shared library corresponding to the server module and
deallocates the struct server_module object.
module.c also defines a global variable module_dir .This is the path of the directory in
which module_open attempts to find shared libraries corresponding to server modules.13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 227

234 Chapter 11 A Sample GNU/Linux Application
These are the functions in server.c :
nserver_run is the main entry point for running the server.This function starts
the server and begins accepting connections, and does not return unless a seri-ous error occurs.The server uses a TCP stream server socket (see Section 5.5.3,“Servers, ”in Chapter 5, “Interprocess Communication ”).
The first argument to 
server_run specifies the local address at which connec-
tions are accepted.A GNU/Linux computer may have multiple networkaddresses, and each address may be bound to a different network interface.
2To
restrict the server to accept connections from a particular interface, specify thecorresponding network address. Specify the local address 
INADDR_ANY to accept
connections for any local address.The second argument to 
server_run is the port number on which to accept
connections. If the port number is already in use, or if it corresponds to a privi-leged port and the server is not being run with superuser privilege, the serverfails.The special value 0 instructs Linux to select an unused port automatically.See the 
inet man page for more information about Internet-domain addresses
and port numbers.The server handles each client connection in a child process created with 
fork
(see Section 3.2.2, “Using fork and exec,”in Chapter 3, “Processes ”).The main
(parent) process continues accepting new connections while existing ones arebeing serviced.The child process invokes 
handle_connection and then closes the
connection socket and exits.
nhandle_connection processes a single client connection, using the socket file
descriptor passed as its argument.This function reads data from the socket andattempts to interpret this as an HTTP page request.The server processes only HTTP version 1.0 and version 1.1 requests.Whenfaced with a different protocol or version, it responds by sending the HTTPresult code 400 and the message 
bad_request_response .The server understands
only the HTTP GET method. If the client requests any other method, theserver responds by sending the HTTP result code 501 and the message
bad_method_response_template .
nIf the client sends a well-formed GET request, handle_connection calls 
handle_get to service it.This function attempts to load a server module 
with a name generated from the requested page. For example, if the clientrequests the page named information, it attempts to load a server module named
information.so . If the module can ’t be loaded, handle_get sends the client the
HTTP result code 404 and the message not_found_response_template .
2.Y our computer might be configured to include such interfaces as eth0, an Ethernet card;
lo, the local (loopback) network; or ppp0, a dial-up network connection.13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 234
235 11.2 Implementation
If the client sends a page request that corresponds to a server module,
handle_get sends a result code 200 header to the client, which indicates that the
request was processed successfully and invokes the module ’s module_generate
function.This function generates the HTML source for a Web page and sends itto the Web client.
nserver_run installs clean_up_child_process as the signal handler for SIGCHLD .
This function simply cleans up terminated child processes (see Section 3.4.4,“Cleaning Up Children Asynchronously, ”in Chapter 3).
11.2.4 The Main Program
main.c (see Listing 11.5) provides the main function for the server program. Its respon-
sibility is to parse command-line options, detect and report command-line errors, andconfigure and run the server.

main.c contains these functions:
nmain invokes getopt_long (see Section 2.1.3, “Using getopt_long ,”in Chapter
2) to parse command-line options. It provides both long and short option forms,the former in the 
long_options array and the latter in the short_options string.
The default value for the server port is 0 and for a local address is INADDR_ANY .
These can be overridden by the --port (-p) and --address (-a) options,
respectively. If the user specifies an address, main calls the library function 
gethostbyname to convert it to a numerical Internet address.3
The default value for the directory from which to load server modules is the directory containing the server executable, as determined by 
get_self_executable_directory .The user may override this with the 
--module-dir (-m) option; main makes sure that the specified directory is 
accessible.By default, verbose messages are not printed.The user may enable them by specifying the 
--verbose (-v) option.
3.gethostbyname performs name resolution using DNS, if necessary.Listing 11.5 Continued13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 238

nIf the user specifies the --help (-h) option or specifies invalid options, main
invokes print_usage , which prints a usage summary and exits.
11.3 Modules
We provide four modules to demonstrate the kind of functionality you could imple-ment using this server implementation. Implementing your own server module is assimple as defining a 
module_generate function to return the appropriate HTML text.
11.3.1 Show Wall-Clock Time
The time.so module (see Listing 11.6) generates a simple page containing the server ’s
local wall-clock time.This module ’s module_generate callsgettimeofday to obtain the
current time (see Section 8.7, “gettimeofday :Wall-Clock Time, ”in Chapter 8, “Linux
System Calls ”) and uses localtime and strftime to generate a text representation of
it.This representation is embedded in the HTML template page_template .
Listing 11.6 (time.c) Server Module to Show Wall-Clock Time
#include <assert.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <sys/time.h>#include <time.h>#include “server.h”/* A template for the HTML page this module generates.  */static char* page_template =
“<html>\n”“ <head>\n”“  <meta http-equiv=\”refresh\” content=\”5\”>\n”“ </head>\n”“ <body>\n”“  <p>The current time is %s.</p>\n”“ </body>\n”“</html>\n”;
void module_generate (int fd){
struct timeval tv;struct tm* ptm;char time_string[40];FILE* fp;/* Obtain the time of day, and convert it to a tm struct.  */gettimeofday (&tv, NULL);ptm = localtime (&tv.tv_sec);
continues13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 239
240 Chapter 11 A Sample GNU/Linux Application
/* Format the date and time, down to a single second.  */strftime (time_string, sizeof (time_string), “%H:%M:%S”, ptm);/* Create a stream corresponding to the client socket file
descriptor.  */
fp = fdopen (fd, “w”);assert (fp != NULL);/* Generate the HTML output.  */fprintf (fp, page_template, time_string);/* All done; flush the stream.  */fflush (fp);
}
This module uses standard C library I/O routines for convenience.The fdopen call
generates a stream pointer ( FILE* ) corresponding to the client socket file descriptor
(see Section B.4, “Relation to Standard C Library I/O Functions, ”in Appendix B,
“Low-Level I/O ”).The module writes to it using fprintf and flushes it using fflush
to prevent the loss of buffered data when the socket is closed.
The HTML page returned by the time.so module includes a <meta> element in
the page header that instructs clients to reload the page every 5 seconds.This way theclient displays the current time.
11.3.2 Show the GNU/Linux Distribution
The issue.so module (see Listing 11.7) displays information about the GNU/Linux
distribution running on the server.This information is traditionally stored in the file
/etc/issue .This module sends the contents of this file, wrapped in a <pre> element of
an HTML page.
Listing 11.7 (issue.c ) Server Module to Display GNU/Linux Distribution
Information
#include <fcntl.h>#include <string.h>#include <sys/sendfile.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>#include “server.h”/* HTML source for the start of the page we generate.  */static char* page_start =

“  <pre>\n”;
/* HTML source for the end of the page we generate.  */static char* page_end =
“  </pre>\n”“ </body>\n”“</html>\n”;
/* HTML source for the page indicating there was a problem opening
/proc/issue.  */
static char* error_page = 
“<html>\n”“ <body>\n”“  <p>Error: Could not open /proc/issue.</p>\n”“ </body>\n”“</html>\n”;
/* HTML source indicating an error.  */static char* error_message = “Error reading /proc/issue.”;void module_generate (int fd){
int input_fd;struct stat file_info;int rval;/* Open /etc/issue.  */input_fd = open (“/etc/issue”, O_RDONLY);if (input_fd == -1)
system_error (“open”);
/* Obtain file information about it.  */rval = fstat (input_fd, &file_info);if (rval == -1) 
/* Either we couldn’t open the file or we couldn’t read from it.  */write (fd, error_page, strlen (error_page));
else {
int rval;off_t offset = 0;/* Write the start of the page.  */write (fd, page_start, strlen (page_start));/* Copy from /proc/issue to the client socket.  */rval = sendfile (fd, input_fd, &offset, file_info.st_size);if (rval == -1)
/* Something went wrong sending the contents of /proc/issue.
Write an error message.  */
write (fd, error_message, strlen (error_message));
continues13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 241
242 Chapter 11 A Sample GNU/Linux Application
/* End the page.  */write (fd, page_end, strlen (page_end));
}close (input_fd);
}
The module first tries to open /etc/issue . If that file can ’t be opened, the module
sends an error page to the client. Otherwise, the module sends the start of the HTML page, contained in 
page_start .Then it sends the contents of /etc/issue using
sendfile (see Section 8.12, “sendfile : Fast Data Transfers, ”in Chapter 8). Finally, it
sends the end of the HTML page, contained in page_end .
Y ou can easily adapt this module to send the contents of another file. If the file
contains a complete HTML page, simply omit the code that sends the contents of
page_start and page_end .Y ou could also adapt the main server implementation to
serve static files, in the manner of a traditional Web server. Using sendfile provides an
extra degree of efficiency.
11.3.3 Show Free Disk Space
The diskfree.so module (see Listing 11.8) generates a page displaying information
about free disk space on the file systems mounted on the server computer.This gener-ated information is simply the output of invoking the 
df -h command. Like issue.so ,
this module wraps the output in a <pre> element of an HTML page.

244 Chapter 11 A Sample GNU/Linux Application
While issue.so sends the contents of a file using sendfile , this module must invoke a
command and redirect its output to the client.T o do this, the module follows thesesteps:
1. First, the module creates a child process using 
fork (see Section 3.2.2, “Using
fork and exec,”in Chapter 3).
2. The child process copies the client socket file descriptor to file descriptors 
STDOUT_FILENO and STDERR_FILENO , which correspond to standard output and
standard error (see Section 2.1.4, “Standard I/O, ”in Chapter 2).The file descrip-
tors are copied using the dup2 call (see Section 5.4.3, “Redirecting the Standard
Input, Output, and Error Streams, ”in Chapter 5).All further output from the
process to either of these streams is sent to the client socket.
3. The child process invokes the dfcommand with the -hoption by calling execv
(see Section 3.2.2, “Using fork and exec,”in Chapter 3).
4. The parent process waits for the child process to exit by calling waitpid (see
Section 3.4.2, “The wait System Calls, ”in Chapter 3).
Y ou could easily adapt this module to invoke a different command and redirect itsoutput to the client.
11.3.4 Summarize Running Processes
The processes.so module (see Listing 11.9) is a more extensive server module imple-
mentation. It generates a page containing a table that summarizes the processes cur-rently running on the server system. Each process is represented by a row in the tablethat lists the PID, the executable program name, the owning user and group names,and the resident set size.

251 11.3 Modules
Gathering process data and formatting it as an HTML table is broken down into several simpler operations:
nget_uid_gid extracts the IDs of the owning user and group of a process.T o do
this, the function invokes stat (see Section B.2, “stat,”in Appendix B) on the
process ’s subdirectory in /proc (see Section 7.2, “Process Entries, ”in Chapter 7).
The user and group that own this directory are identical to the process ’s owning
user and group.
nget_user_name returns the username corresponding to a UID.This function
simply calls the C library function getpwuid , which consults the system ’s
/etc/passwd file and returns a copy of the result. get_group_name returns the
group name corresponding to a GID. It uses the getgrgid call.
nget_program_name returns the name of the program running in a specified
process.This information is extracted from the stat entry in the process ’s direc-
tory under /proc (see Section 7.2, “Process Entries, ”in Chapter 7).We use this
entry rather than examining the exesymbolic link (see Section 7.2.4, “Process
Executable, ”in Chapter 7) or cmdline entry (see Section 7.2.2, “Process
Argument List, ”in Chapter 7) because the latter two are inaccessible if the
process running the server isn ’t owned by the same user as the process being
examined.Also, reading from stat doesn ’t force Linux to page the process under
examination back into memory, if it happens to be swapped out.
nget_rss returns the resident set size of a process.This information is available as
the second element in the contents of the process ’s statm entry (see Section
7.2.6, “Process Memory Statistics, ”in Chapter 7) in its /proc subdirectory.
nformat_process_info generates a string containing HTML elements for a 
single table row, representing a single process.After calling the functions listedpreviously to obtain this information, it allocates a buffer and generates HTMLusing 
snprintf .
nmodule_generate generates the entire HTML page, including the table.The 
output consists of one string containing the start of the page and the table (in
page_start ), one string for each table row (generated by format_process_info ),
and one string containing the end of the table and the page (in page_end ).
module_generate determines the PIDs of the processes running on the system
by examining the contents of /proc . It obtains a listing of this directory using
opendir and readdir (see Section B.6, “Reading Directory Contents, ”in
Appendix B). It scans the contents, looking for entries whose names are com-posed entirely of digits; these are taken to be process entries.Potentially a large number of strings must be written to the client socket —one
each for the page start and end, plus one for each process. If we were to writeeach string to the client socket file descriptor with a separate call to 
write , this
would generate unnecessary network traffic because each string may be sent in aseparate network packet.13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 251
252 Chapter 11 A Sample GNU/Linux Application
T o optimize packing of data into packets, we use a single call to writev instead
(see Section B.3, “Vector Reads and Writes, ”in Appendix B).T o do this, we
must construct an array of struct iovec objects,vec. However, because we do
not know the number of processes beforehand, we must start with a small arrayand expand it as new processes are added.The variable 
vec_length contains the
number of elements of vecthat are used, while vec_size contains the allocated
size of vec.When vec_length is about to exceed vec_size , we expand vecto
twice its size by calling xrealloc .When we ’re done with the vector write, we
must deallocate all of the dynamically allocated strings pointed to by vec, and
then vecitself.
11.4 Using the Server
If we were planning to distribute this program in source form, maintain it on anongoing basis, or port it to other platforms, we probably would want to package itusing GNU Automake and GNU Autoconf, or a similar configuration automation sys-tem. Such tools are outside the scope of this book; for more information about them,consult GNU Autoconf,Automake, and Libtool (by Vaughan, Elliston,Tromey, and Taylor,
published by New Riders, 2000).
11.4.1 The Makefile
Instead of using Autoconf or a similar tool, we provide a simple Makefile compatible
with GNU Make4so that it ’s easy to compile and link the server and its modules.The
Makefile is shown in Listing 11.10. See the info page for GNU Make for details of
the file ’s syntax.
Listing 11.10 (Makefile ) GNU Make Configuration File for Server Example

253 11.4 Using the Server
# Default target: build everything.all:            server $(MODULES)# Clean up build products.clean:
rm -f $(OBJECTS) $(MODULES) server
# The main server program.  Link with -Wl,-export-dyanamic so# dynamically loaded modules can bind symbols in the program.  Link in# libdl, which contains calls for dynamic loading.server:         $(OBJECTS)
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -Wl,-export-dynamic -o $@ $^ -ldl
# All object files in the server depend on server.h.  But use the# default rule for building object files from source files.$(OBJECTS):     server.h# Rule for building module shared libraries from the corresponding# source files.   Compile -fPIC and generate a shared object file.$(MODULES): \%.so:           %.c server.h
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -fPIC -shared -o $@ $<
The Makefile provides these targets:
nall(the default if you invoke make without arguments because it ’s the first target
in the Makefile ) includes the server executable and all the modules.The mod-
ules are listed in the variable MODULES .
nclean deletes any build products that are produced by the Makefile .
nserver links the server executable.The source files listed in the variable SOURCES
are compiled and linked in.
nThe last rule is a generic pattern for compiling shared object files for servermodules from the corresponding source files.
Note that source files for server modules are compiled with the 
-fPIC option because
they are linked into shared libraries (see Section 2.3.2, “Shared Libraries, ”in Chapter 2).
Also observe that the server executable is linked with the -Wl,-export-dynamic
compiler option.With this option, GCC passes the -export-dynamic option to the
linker, which creates an executable file that also exports its external symbols as a sharedlibrary.This allows modules, which are dynamically loaded as shared libraries, to refer-ence functions from 
common.c that are linked statically into the server executable.13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 253
254 Chapter 11 A Sample GNU/Linux Application
11.4.2 Building the Server
Building the program is easy. From the directory containing the sources, simply invoke
make:
% makecc -Wall -g   -c -o server.o server.ccc -Wall -g   -c -o module.o module.ccc -Wall -g   -c -o common.o common.ccc -Wall -g   -c -o main.o main.ccc -Wall -g -Wl,-export-dynamic -o server server.o module.o common.o main.o -ldlcc -Wall -g -fPIC -shared -o diskfree.so diskfree.ccc -Wall -g -fPIC -shared -o issue.so issue.ccc -Wall -g -fPIC -shared -o processes.so processes.ccc -Wall -g -fPIC -shared -o time.so time.c
This builds the server program and the server module shared libraries.
% ls -l server *.so-rwxr-xr-x    1 samuel   samuel      25769 Mar 11 01:15 diskfree.so-rwxr-xr-x    1 samuel   samuel      31184 Mar 11 01:15 issue.so-rwxr-xr-x    1 samuel   samuel      41579 Mar 11 01:15 processes.so-rwxr-xr-x    1 samuel   samuel      71758 Mar 11 01:15 server-rwxr-xr-x    1 samuel   samuel      13980 Mar 11 01:15 time.so
11.4.3 Running the Server
T o run the server, simply invoke the server executable.
If you do not specify the server port number with the --port (-p) option, Linux
will choose one for you; in this case, specify --verbose (-v) to make the server print
out the port number in use.
If you do not specify an address with --address (-a), the server runs on all your
computer ’s network addresses. If your computer is attached to a network, that means
that others will be capable of accessing the server, provided that they know the correctport number to use and page to request. For security reasons, it ’s a good idea to spec-
ify the 
localhost address until you ’re confident that the server works correctly and is
not releasing any information that you prefer to not make public. Binding to the
localhost causes the server to bind to the local network device (designated “lo”)—
only programs running on the same computer can connect to it. If you specify a dif-ferent address, it must be an address that corresponds to your computer:
% ./server --address localhost --port 4000
The server is now running. Open a browser window, and attempt to contact the serverat this port number. Request a page whose name matches one of the modules. Forinstance, to invoke the 
diskfree.so module, use this URL:
http://localhost:4000/diskfree13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 254
255 11.5 Finishing Up
Instead of 4000, enter the port number you specified (or the port number that Linux
chose for you). Press Ctrl+C to kill the server when you ’re done.
If you didn ’t specify localhost as the server address, you can also connect to the
server with a Web browser running on another computer by using your computer ’s
hostname in the URL —for example:
http://host.domain.com:4000/diskfree
If you specify the --verbose (-v) option, the server prints some information at startup
and displays the numerical Internet address of each client that connects to it. If youconnect via the 
localhost address, the client address will always be 127.0.0.1.
If you experiment with writing your own server modules, you may place them in a
different directory than the one containing the server module. In this case, specify
that directory with the --module-dir (-m) option.The server will look in this direc-
tory for server modules instead.
If you forget the syntax of the command-line options, invoke server with the 
--help (-h) option.
% ./server --helpUsage: ./server [ options ]
-a, --address ADDR        Bind to local address (by default, bind
to all local addresses).
-h, --help                Print this information.-m, --module-dir DIR      Load modules from specified directory
(by default, use executable directory).
-p, --port PORT           Bind to specified port.-v, --verbose             Print verbose messages.
11.5 Finishing Up
If you were really planning on releasing this program for general use, you ’d need to
write documentation for it as well. Many people don ’t realize that writing good docu-
mentation is just as difficult and time-consuming —and just as important —as writing
good software. However, software documentation is a subject for another book, sowe’ll leave you with a few references of where to learn more about documenting
GNU/Linux software.
Yo u’d probably want to write a man page for the 
server program, for instance.This
is the first place many users will look for information about a program. Man pages areformatted using a classic UNIX formatting system 
troff .T o view the man page for
troff , which describes the format of troff files, invoke the following:
% man troff
T o learn about how GNU/Linux locates man pages, consult the man page for the man
command itself by invoking this:
% man man13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 255
256 Chapter 11 A Sample GNU/Linux Application
Y ou might also want to write info pages, using the GNU Info system, for the serverand its modules. Naturally, documentation about the info system comes in info format;to view it, invoke this line:
% info info
Many GNU/Linux programs come with documentation in plain text or HTML formats as well.Happy GNU/Linux programming!13 0430 CH11  5/22/01  10:46 AM  Page 256

D EVELOPING CORRECT ,FASTC ORC++ GNU/L INUX PROGRAMS requires more
than just understanding the GNU/Linux operating system and its system calls. In thisappendix, we discuss development tools to find runtime errors such as illegal use ofdynamically allocated memory and to determine which parts of a program are takingmost of the execution time.Analyzing a program ’s source code can reveal some of this
information; by using these runtime tools and actually executing the program, you canfind out much more.
A.1 Static Program Analysis
Some programming errors can be detected using static analysis tools that analyze theprogram ’s source code. If you invoke GCC with 
-Wall and -pedantic , the compiler
issues warnings about risky or possibly erroneous programming constructions. Byeliminating such constructions, you ’ll reduce the risk of program bugs, and you ’ll find
it easier to compile your programs on different GNU/Linux variants and even onother operating systems.15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  10:53 AM  Page 259
260 Appendix A Other Development Tools
Using various command options, you can cause GCC to issue warnings about
many different types of questionable programming constructs.The -Wall option
enables most of these checks. For example, the compiler will produce a warning about a comment that begins within another comment, about an incorrect return typespecified for 
main, and about a non void function omitting a return statement. If you
specify the -pedantic option, GCC emits warnings demanded by strict ANSI C and
ISO C++ compliance. For example, use of the GNU asmextension causes a warning
using this option.A few GNU extensions, such as using alternate keywords beginningwith 
__ (two underscores), will not trigger warning messages.Although the GCC
info pages deprecate use of this option, we recommend that you use it anyway andavoid most GNU language extensions because GCC extensions tend to changethrough time and frequently interact poorly with code optimization.
Listing A.1 (hello.c) Hello World Program
main ()
{
printf (“Hello, world.\n”);
}
Consider compiling the “Hello World” program shown in Listing A.1.Though GCC
compiles the program without complaint, the source code does not obey ANSI Crules. If you enable warnings by compiling with the 
-Wall -pedantic , GCC reveals
three questionable constructs.
% gcc -Wall -pedantic hello.c
hello.c:2: warning: return type defaults to ‘int’hello.c: In function ‘main’:hello.c:3: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘printf’hello.c:4: warning: control reaches end of non-void function
These warnings indicate that the following problems occurred:
nThe return type for main was not specified.
nThe function printf is implicitly declared because <stdio.h> is not included.
nThe function, implicitly declared to return an int, actually returns no value.
Analyzing a program’s source code cannot find all programming mistakes and ineffi-
ciencies. In the next section, we present four tools to find mistakes in using dynami-cally allocated memory. In the subsequent section, we show how to analyze theprogram’s execution time using the 
gprof profiler.15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  2:40 PM  Page 260
261 A.2 Finding Dynamic Memory Errors
A.2 Finding Dynamic Memory Errors
When writing a program, you frequently can ’t know how much memory the program
will need when it runs. For example, a line read from a file at runtime might have anyfinite length. C and C++ programs use 
malloc ,free, and their variants to dynamically
allocate memory while the program is running.The rules for dynamic memory useinclude these:
nThe number of allocation calls (calls to malloc ) must exactly match the number
of deallocation calls (calls to free).
nReads and writes to the allocated memory must occur within the memory, notoutside its range.
nThe allocated memory cannot be used before it is allocated or after it is deallocated.
Because dynamic memory allocation and deallocation occur at runtime, static programanalysis rarely find violations. Instead, memory-checking tools run the program, col-lecting data to determine if any of these rules have been violated.The violations a toolmay find include the following:
nReading from memory before allocating it
nWriting to memory before allocating it
nReading before the beginning of allocated memory
nWriting before the beginning of allocated memory
nReading after the end of allocated memory
nWriting after the end of allocated memory
nReading from memory after its deallocation
nWriting to memory after its deallocation
nFailing to deallocate allocated memory
nDeallocating the same memory twice
nDeallocating memory that is not allocated
It is also useful to warn about requesting an allocation with 0 bytes, which probablyindicates programmer error.
Table A.1 indicates four different tools ’diagnostic capabilities. Unfortunately, no
single tool diagnoses all the memory use errors.Also, no tool claims to detect readingor writing before allocating memory, but doing so will probably cause a segmentationfault. Deallocating memory twice will probably also cause a segmentation fault.Thesetools diagnose only errors that actually occur while the program is running. If you runthe program with inputs that cause no memory to be allocated, the tools will indicateno memory errors.T o test a program thoroughly, you must run the program using dif-ferent inputs to ensure that every possible path through the program occurs.Also, youmay use only one tool at a time, so you ’ll have to repeat testing with several tools to
get the best error checking.15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  10:53 AM  Page 261

In the sections that follow, we first describe how to use the more easily used malloc

A.2.1 A Program to Test Memory Allocation andDeallocation
We’ll use the malloc-use program in Listing A.2 to illustrate memory allocation, deal-
location, and use.T o begin running it, specify the maximum number of allocatedmemory regions as its only command-line argument. For example,
malloc-use 12
creates an array Awith 12 character pointers that do not point to anything.The 
program accepts five different commands:
nT o allocate bbytes pointed to by array entry A[i], enter a i b.The array index i
can be any non-negative number smaller than the command-line argument.Thenumber of bytes must be non-negative.
nT o deallocate memory at array index i, enter d i.
nT o read the pth character from the allocated memory at index i(as in A[i][p] ),
enter r i p. Here, pcan have an integral value.
nT o write a character to the pth position in the allocated memory at index i,
enter w i p.
nWhen finished, enter q.
We’ll present the program ’s code later, in Section A.2.7, and illustrate how to use it.15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  10:53 AM  Page 262
263 A.2 Finding Dynamic Memory Errors
A.2.2 malloc Checking
The memory allocation functions provided by the GNU C library can detect writingbefore the beginning of an allocation and deallocating the same allocation twice.Defining the environment variable 
MALLOC_CHECK_ to the value 2 causes a program to
halt when such an error is detected. (Note the environment variable ’s ending under-
score.) There is no need to recompile the program.
We illustrate diagnosing a write to memory to a position just before the beginning
of an allocation.
% export MALLOC_CHECK_=2% ./malloc-use 12Please enter a command: a 0 10Please enter a command: w 0 -1Please enter a command: d 0Aborted (core dumped)
export turns on malloc checking. Specifying the value 2 causes the program to halt as
soon as an error is detected.
Using malloc checking is advantageous because the program need not be recom-
piled, but its capability to diagnose errors is limited. Basically, it checks that the alloca-tor data structures have not been corrupted.Thus, it can detect double deallocation ofthe same allocation.Also, writing just before the beginning of a memory allocationcan usually be detected because the allocator stores the size of each memory allocationjust before the allocated region.Thus, writing just before the allocated memory willcorrupt this number. Unfortunately, consistency checking can occur only when yourprogram calls allocation routines, not when it accesses memory, so many illegal readsand writes can occur before an error is detected. In the previous example, the illegalwrite was detected only when the allocated memory was deallocated.
A.2.3 Finding Memory Leaks Using mtrace
The mtrace tool helps diagnose the most common error when using dynamic 
memory: failure to match allocations and deallocations.There are four steps to using
mtrace , which is available with the GNU C library:
1. Modify the source code to include <mcheck.h> and to invoke mtrace () as soon
as the program starts, at the beginning of main.The call to mtrace turns on
tracking of memory allocations and deallocations.
2. Specify the name of a file to store information about all memory allocations and
deallocations:
% export MALLOC_TRACE=memory.log
3. Run the program.All memory allocations and deallocations are stored in the
logging file.15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  10:53 AM  Page 263
264 Appendix A Other Development Tools
4. Using the mtrace command, analyze the memory allocations and deallocations
to ensure that they match.
% mtrace my_program $MALLOC_TRACE
The messages produced by mtrace are relatively easy to understand. For example, for
our malloc-use example, the output would look like this:
- 0000000000 Free 3 was never alloc’d malloc-use.c:39Memory not freed:-----------------
Address     Size     Caller
0x08049d48      0xc  at malloc-use.c:30
These messages indicate an attempt on line 39 of malloc-use.c to free memory that
was never allocated, and an allocation of memory on line 30 that was never freed.
mtrace diagnoses errors by having the executable record all memory allocations 
and deallocations in the file specified by the MALLOC_TRACE environment variable.The
executable must terminate normally for the data to be written.The mtrace command
analyzes this file and lists unmatched allocations and deallocations.
A.2.4 Using ccmalloc
The ccmalloc library diagnoses dynamic memory errors by replacing malloc and free
with code tracing their use. If the program terminates gracefully, it produces a reportof memory leaks and other errors.The 
ccmalloc library was written by Armin Bierce.
Yo u’ll probably have to download and install the ccmalloc library yourself.
Download it from http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/biere/projects/ccmalloc/ ,
unpack the code, and run configure . Run make and make install , copy the 
ccmalloc.cfg file to the directory where you ’ll run the program you want to check,
and rename the copy to .ccmalloc . Now you are ready to use the tool.
The program ’s object files must be linked with ccmalloc ’s library and the dynamic
linking library.Append -lccmalloc -ldl to your link command, for instance.
% gcc -g -Wall -pedantic malloc-use.o -o ccmalloc-use -lccmalloc –ldl
Execute the program to produce a report. For example, running our malloc-use pro-
gram to allocate but not deallocate memory produces the following report:

The last few lines indicate the chain of function calls that allocated memory that wasnot deallocated.
T o use 
ccmalloc to diagnose writes before the beginning or after the end of the
allocated region, you ’ll have to modify the .ccmalloc file in the current directory.This
file is read when the program starts execution.
A.2.5 Electric Fence
Written by Bruce Perens, Electric Fence halts executing programs on the exact line where a write or a read outside an allocation occurs.This is the only tool that discovers illegal reads. It is included in most GNU/Linux distributions, but the sourcecode can be found at 
http://www.perens.com/FreeSoftware/ .15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  10:53 AM  Page 265
266 Appendix A Other Development Tools
As with ccmalloc , your program ’s object files must be linked with Electric Fence ’s
library by appending -lefence to the linking command, for instance:
% gcc -g -Wall -pedantic malloc-use.o -o emalloc-use –lefence
As the program runs, allocated memory uses are checked for correctness.A violationcauses a segmentation fault:
% ./emalloc-use 12
Electric Fence 2.0.5 Copyright (C) 1987-1998 Bruce Perens.
Please enter a command: a 0 12Please enter a command: r 0 12Segmentation fault
Using a debugger, you can determine the context of the illegal action.
By default, Electric Fence diagnoses only accesses beyond the ends of allocations.T o
find accesses before the beginning of allocations instead of accesses beyond the end of
allocations, use this code:
% export EF_PROTECT_BELOW=1
T o find accesses to deallocated memory, set EF_PROTECT_FREE to 1. More capabilities
are described in the libefence manual page.
Electric Fence diagnoses illegal memory accesses by storing each allocation on at
least two memory pages. It places the allocation at the end of the first page; any accessbeyond the end of the allocation, on the second page, causes a segmentation fault. Ifyou set 
EF_PROTECT_BELOW to 1, it places the allocation at the beginning of the second
page instead. Because it allocates two memory pages per call to malloc , Electric Fence
can use an enormous amount of memory. Use this library for debugging only.
A.2.6 Choosing Among the Different Memory-DebuggingTools
We have discussed four separate, incompatible tools to diagnose erroneous use ofdynamic memory. How does a GNU/Linux programmer ensure that dynamic mem-ory is correctly used? No tool guarantees diagnosing all errors, but using any of themdoes increase the probability of finding errors.T o ease finding dynamically allocatedmemory errors, separately develop and test the code that deals with dynamic memory.This reduces the amount of code that you must search for errors. If you are usingC++, write a class that handles all dynamic memory use. If you are using C, minimizethe number of functions using allocation and deallocation.When testing this code, besure to use only one tool at a one time because they are incompatible.When testing aprogram, be sure to vary how the program executes, to test the most commonly exe-cuted portions of the code.
Which of the four tools should you use? Because failing to match allocations and
deallocations is the most common dynamic memory error, use 
mtrace during initial
development.The program is available on all GNU/Linux systems and has been welltested.After ensuring that the number of allocations and deallocations match, use15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  10:53 AM  Page 266
267 A.2 Finding Dynamic Memory Errors
Electric Fence to find illegal memory accesses.This will eliminate almost all memoryerrors.When using Electric Fence, you will need to be careful to not perform toomany allocations and deallocations because each allocation requires at least two pagesof memory. Using these two tools will reveal most memory errors.

and Deallocation, ”for a description of how to use it.

A.3 Profiling
Now that your program is (hopefully) correct, we turn to speeding its execution.Using the profiler 
gprof , you can determine which functions require the most execu-
tion time.This can help you determine which parts of the program to optimize orrewrite to execute more quickly. It can also help you find errors. For example, youmay find that a particular function is called many more times than you expect.15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  10:53 AM  Page 269
270 Appendix A Other Development Tools
In this section, we describe how to use gprof . Rewriting code to run more quickly
requires creativity and careful choice of algorithms.
Obtaining profiling information requires three steps:
1. Compile and link your program to enable profiling.2. Execute your program to generate profiling data.3. Use 
gprof to analyze and display the profiling data.
Before we illustrate these steps, we introduce a large enough program to make profiling interesting.
A.3.1 A Simple Calculator
T o illustrate profiling, we ’ll use a simple calculator program.T o ensure that the calcula-
tor takes a nontrivial amount of time, we ’ll use unary numbers for calculations, some-
thing we would definitely not want to do in a real-world program. Code for thisprogram appears at the end of this chapter.
A unary number is represented by as many symbols as its value. For example, the
number 1 is represented by “x,”2 by “xx,”and 3 by “xxx.”Instead of using x ’s, our
program represents a non-negative number using a linked list with as many elementsas the number ’s value.The 
number.c file contains routines to create the number 0, add
1 to a number, subtract 1 from a number, and add, subtract, and multiply numbers.Another function converts a string holding a non-negative decimal number to a unarynumber, and a function converts from a unary number to an 
int.Addition is imple-
mented using repeated addition of 1s, while subtraction uses repeated removal of 1s.Multiplication is defined using repeated addition.The unary predicates 
even and odd
each return the unary number for 1 if and only if its one operand is even or odd,respectively; otherwise they return the unary number for 0.The two predicates aremutually recursive. For example, a number is even if it is zero, or if one less than thenumber is odd.
The calculator accepts one-line postfix expressions
1and prints each expression ’s
value—for example:
% ./calculatorPlease enter a postfix expression:2 3 +5Please enter a postfix expression:2 3 + 4 -1
1. In postfix notation, a binary operator is placed after its operands instead of between them.
So, for example, to multiply 6 and 8, you would use 6 8 ×.T o multiply 6 and 8 and then add 5
to the result, you would use 6 8 ×5 +.15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  10:53 AM  Page 270
271 A.3 Profiling
The calculator, defined in calculator.c , reads each expression, storing intermediate
values on a stack of unary numbers, defined in stack.c .The stack stores its unary
numbers in a linked list.
A.3.2 Collecting Profiling Information
The first step in profiling a program is to annotate its executable to collect profilinginformation.T o do so, use the 
-pgcompiler flag when both compiling the object files
and linking. For example, consider this code:
% gcc -pg -c -o calculator.o calculator.c% gcc -pg -c -o stack.o stack.c% gcc -pg -c -o number.o number.c% gcc -pg calculator.o stack.o number.o -o calculator
This enables collecting information about function calls and timing information.T ocollect line-by-line use information, also specify the debugging flag 
-g.T o count basic
block executions, such as the number of do-loop iterations, use -a.
The second step is to run the program.While it is running, profiling data is col-
lected into a file named gmon.out , only for those portions of the code that are exer-
cised.Y ou must vary the program ’s input or commands to exercise the code sections
that you want to profile.The program must terminate normally for the profiling file tobe written.
A.3.3 Displaying Profiling Data
Given the name of an executable, gprof analyzes the gmon.out file to display informa-
tion about how much time each function required. For example, consider the “flat”
profiling data for computing 1787 ×13 – 1918 using our calculator program, which is
produced by executing gprof ./calculator :
Flat profile:Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.

Computing the function decrement_number and all the functions it calls required
26.07% of the program ’s total execution time. It was called 20,795,463 times. Each
individual execution required 0.0 seconds —namely, a time too small to measure.The
addfunction was invoked 1,787 times, presumably to compute the product. Each call15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  10:53 AM  Page 271
272 Appendix A Other Development Tools
required 0.92 seconds.The copy_number function was invoked only 1,788 times, while
it and the functions it calls required only 0.15% of the total execution time.Sometimes the 
mcount and profil functions used by profiling appear in the data.
In addition to the flat profile data , which indicates the total time spent within each
function, gprof produces call graph data showing the time spent in each function and
its children within the context of a function call chain:

The first frame shows that executing main and its children required 100% of the pro-
gram’s 6.75 seconds. It called apply_binary_function twice, which was called a total
of two times throughout the entire program. Its caller was <spontaneous> ; this indi-
cates that the profiler was not capable of determining who called main.This first frame
also shows that string_to_number called push_stack three times but was called five
times throughout the program.The third frame shows that executing product and the
functions it calls required 99.8% of the program ’s total execution time. It was invoked
once by apply_binary_function .
The call graph data displays the total time spent executing a function and its chil-
dren. If the function call graph is a tree, this number is easy to compute, but recur-sively defined functions must be treated specially. For example, the 
even function calls
odd, which calls even. Each largest such call cycle is given its own number and is dis-15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  10:53 AM  Page 272

In this section, we have briefly discussed only some of gprof ’s features. Its info
pages contain information about other useful features:
nUse the -soption to sum the execution results from several different runs.
nUse the -coption to identify children that could have been called but were not.
nUse the -loption to display line-by-line profiling information.
nUse the -Aoption to display source code annotated with percentage execution
numbers.
The info pages also provide more information about the interpretation of the analyzed data.
A.3.4 How gprofCollects Data
When a profiled executable runs, every time a function is called its count is also incre-mented.Also,
gprof periodically interrupts the executable to determine the currently
executing function.These samples determine function execution times. BecauseLinux ’s clock ticks are 0.01 seconds apart, these interruptions occur, at most, every
0.01 seconds.Thus, profiles for quickly executing programs or for quickly executinginfrequently called functions may be inaccurate.T o avoid these inaccuracies, run theexecutable for longer periods of time, or sum together profile data from several execu-tions. Read about the 
-soption to sum profiling data in gprof ’s info pages.15 0430 APPA  5/22/01  10:53 AM  Page 273

Low-Level I/O
B
C PROGRAMMERS ON GNU/L INUX HAVE TWO SETS OF INPUT /OUTPUT functions at
their disposal.The standard C library provides I/O functions: printf ,fopen , and so
on.1The Linux kernel itself provides another set of I/O operations that operate at a
lower level than the C library functions.
Because this book is for people who already know the C language, we ’ll assume
that you have encountered and know how to use the C library I/O functions.
Often there are good reasons to use Linux ’s low-level I/O functions. Many of these
are kernel system calls2and provide the most direct access to underlying system capa-
bilities that is available to application programs. In fact, the standard C library I/Oroutines are implemented on top of the Linux low-level I/O system calls. Using thelatter is usually the most efficient way to perform input and output operations —and is
sometimes more convenient, too.
1.The C++ standard library provides iostreams with similar functionality.The standard C
library is also available in the C++ language.
2. See Chapter 8, “Linux System Calls, ”for an explanation of the difference between a system
call and an ordinary function call.16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 281
282 Appendix B Low-Level I/O
Throughout this book, we assume that you ’re familiar with the calls described in this
appendix.Y ou may already be familiar with them because they ’re nearly the same as
those provided on other UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems (and on the Win32platform as well). If you ’re not familiar with them, however, read on; you ’ll find the
rest of the book much easier to understand if you familiarize yourself with this material first.
B.1 Reading and Writing Data
The first I/O function you likely encountered when you first learned the C languagewas 
printf .This formats a text string and then prints it to standard output.The gener-
alized version, fprintf , can print the text to a stream other than standard output.A
stream is represented by a FILE* pointer.Y ou obtain a FILE* pointer by opening a file
with fopen. When you ’re done, you can close it with fclose . In addition to fprintf ,
you can use such functions as fputc ,fputs , and fwrite to write data to the stream, or
fscanf ,fgetc ,fgets , and fread to read data.
With the Linux low-level I/O operations, you use a handle called a file descriptor
instead of a FILE* pointer.A file descriptor is an integer value that refers to a particu-
lar instance of an open file in a single process. It can be open for reading, for writing,or for both reading and writing.A file descriptor doesn ’t have to refer to an open file;
it can represent a connection with another system component that is capable of send-ing or receiving data. For example, a connection to a hardware device is representedby a file descriptor (see Chapter 6, “Devices ”), as is an open socket (see Chapter 5,
“Interprocess Communication, ”Section 5.5, “Sockets ”) or one end of a pipe (see
Section 5.4, “Pipes”).
Include the header files 
<fcntl.h> ,<sys/types.h> ,<sys/stat.h> , and <unistd.h>
if you use any of the low-level I/O functions described here.
B.1.1 Opening a File
T o open a file and produce a file descriptor that can access that file, use the open call.
It takes as arguments the path name of the file to open, as a character string, and flagsspecifying how to open it.Y ou can use 
open to create a new file; if you do, pass a third
argument that specifies the access permissions to set for the new file.
If the second argument is O_RDONLY , the file is opened for reading only; an error
will result if you subsequently try to write to the resulting file descriptor. Similarly,
O_WRONLY causes the file descriptor to be write-only. Specifying O_RDWR produces a file
descriptor that can be used both for reading and for writing. Note that not all filesmay be opened in all three modes. For instance, the permissions on a file might forbida particular process from opening it for reading or for writing; a file on a read-onlydevice such as a CD-ROM drive may not be opened for writing.16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 282
283 B.1 Reading and Writing Data
Y ou can specify additional options by using the bitwise or of this value with one or
more flags.These are the most commonly used values:
nSpecify O_TRUNC to truncate the opened file, if it previously existed. Data written
to the file descriptor will replace previous contents of the file.
nSpecify O_APPEND to append to an existing file. Data written to the file descriptor
will be added to the end of the file.
nSpecify O_CREAT to create a new file. If the filename that you provide to open
does not exist, a new file will be created, provided that the directory containingit exists and that the process has permission to create files in that directory. If thefile already exists, it is opened instead.
nSpecify O_EXCL with O_CREAT to force creation of a new file. If the file already
exists, the open call will fail.
If you call open with O_CREAT , provide an additional third argument specifying the per-
missions for the new file. See Chapter 10, “Security, ”Section 10.3, “File System
Permissions, ”for a description of permission bits and how to use them.
For example, the program in Listing B.1 creates a new file with the filename speci-
fied on the command line. It uses the O_EXCL flag with open, so if the file already
exists, an error occurs.The new file is given read and write permissions for the ownerand owning group, and read permissions only for others. (If your umask is set to anonzero value, the actual permissions may be more restrictive.)
Umasks
When you create a new file with open , some permission bits that you specify may be turned off. This is
because your umask is set to a nonzero value. A process ’s umask specifies bits that are masked out of all
newly created files ’ permissions. The actual permissions used are the bitwise and of the permissions you
specify to open and the bitwise complement of the umask.
To change your umask from the shell, use the umask command, and specify the numerical value of the
mask, in octal notation. To change the umask for a running process, use the umask call, passing it the
desired mask value to use for subsequent open calls.
For example, calling this line
umask (S_IRWXO |S_IWGRP);
in a program, or invoking this command
% umask 027
specifies that write permissions for group members and read, write, and execute permissions for otherswill always be masked out of a new file ’s permissions.16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 283

Note that the length of the new file is 0 because the program didn ’t write any data to it.
B.1.2 Closing File Descriptors
When you ’re done with a file descriptor, close it with close . In some cases, such as the
program in Listing B.1, it ’s not necessary to call close explicitly because Linux closes
all open file descriptors when a process terminates (that is, when the program ends).Of course, once you close a file descriptor, you should no longer use it.
Closing a file descriptor may cause Linux to take a particular action, depending on
the nature of the file descriptor. For example, when you close a file descriptor for anetwork socket, Linux closes the network connection between the two computerscommunicating through the socket.
Linux limits the number of open file descriptors that a process may have open at a
time. Open file descriptors use kernel resources, so it ’s good to close file descriptors
when you ’re done with them.A typical limit is 1,024 file descriptors per process.Y ou
can adjust this limit with the 
setrlimit system call; see Section 8.5, “getrlimit and
setrlimit : Resource Limits, ”for more information.16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 284
285 B.1 Reading and Writing Data
B.1.3 Writing Data
Write data to a file descriptor using the write call. Provide the file descriptor, a
pointer to a buffer of data, and the number of bytes to write.The file descriptor mustbe open for writing.The data written to the file need not be a character string;
write
copies arbitrary bytes from the buffer to the file descriptor.
The program in Listing B.2 appends the current time to the file specified on the
command line. If the file doesn ’t exist, it is created.This program also uses the time,
localtime , and asctime functions to obtain and format the current time; see their
respective man pages for more information.
Listing B.2 (timestamp.c ) Append a Timestamp to a File
#include <fcntl.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <time.h>#include <unistd.h>/* Return a character string representing the current date and time.  */char* get_timestamp (){
time_t now = time (NULL);return asctime (localtime (&now));
}int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
/* The file to which to append the timestamp.  */char* filename = argv[1];/* Get the current timestamp.  */char* timestamp = get_timestamp ();/* Open the file for writing.  If it exists, append to it;
otherwise, create a new file.  */
int fd = open (filename, O_WRONLY 
|O_CREAT |O_APPEND, 0666);
/* Compute the length of the timestamp string.  */size_t length = strlen (timestamp);/* Write the timestamp to the file.  */write (fd, timestamp, length);/* All done.  */close (fd);return 0;
}16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 285
286 Appendix B Low-Level I/O
Here’s how the timestamp program works:
% ./timestamp tsfile% cat tsfileThu Feb  1 23:25:20 2001% ./timestamp tsfile% cat tsfileThu Feb  1 23:25:20 2001Thu Feb  1 23:25:47 2001
Note that the first time we invoke timestamp , it creates the file tsfile , while the 
second time it appends to it.
The write call returns the number of bytes that were actually written, or -1 if an
error occurred. For certain kinds of file descriptors, the number of bytes actually writ-ten may be less than the number of bytes requested. In this case, it ’s up to you to call
write again to write the rest of the data.The function in Listing B.3 demonstrates
how you might do this. Note that for some applications, you may have to check forspecial conditions in the middle of the writing operation. For example, if you ’re writ-
ing to a network socket, you ’ll have to augment this function to detect whether the
network connection was closed in the middle of the write operation, and if it has, toreact appropriately.
Listing B.3 (write-all.c ) Write All of a Buffer of Data
/* Write all of COUNT bytes from BUFFER to file descriptor FD.
Returns -1 on error, or the number of bytes written.  */
ssize_t write_all (int fd, const void* buffer, size_t count){
size_t left_to_write = count;while (left_to_write > 0) {
size_t written = write (fd, buffer, count);if (written == -1)
/* An error occurred; bail.  */return -1;
else
/* Keep count of how much more we need to write.  */left_to_write -= written;
}/* We should have written no more than COUNT bytes!  */assert (left_to_write == 0);/* The number of bytes written is exactly COUNT.  */return count;
}16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 286
287 B.1 Reading and Writing Data
B.1.4 Reading Data
The corresponding call for reading data is read.L i k e  write , it takes a file descriptor, a
pointer to a buffer, and a count.The count specifies how many bytes are read from thefile descriptor into the buffer.The call to 
read returns -1 on error or the number of
bytes actually read.This may be smaller than the number of bytes requested, for exam-ple, if there aren ’t enough bytes left in the file.
Reading DOS/Windows Text Files
After reading this book, we ’re positive that you ’ll choose to write all your programs for GNU/Linux.
However, your programs may occasionally need to read text files generated by DOS or Windows pro-grams. It ’s important to anticipate an important difference in how text files are structured between these
two platforms.In GNU/Linux text files, each line is separated from the next with a newline character. A newline is repre-sented by the character constant 
’\n’ , which has ASCII code 10. On Windows, however, lines are sepa-
rated by a two-character combination: a carriage return character (the character ’\r,’which has ASCII
code 13), followed by a newline character.Some GNU/Linux text editors display 
^Mat the end of each line when showing a Windows text file —this
is the carriage return character. Emacs displays Windows text files properly but indicates them by show-ing 
(DOS) in the mode line at the bottom of the buffer. Some Windows editors, such as Notepad, display
all the text in a GNU/Linux text file on a single line because they expect a carriage return at the end ofeach line. Other programs for both GNU/Linux and Windows that process text files may report mysteriouserrors when given as input a text file in the wrong format.If your program reads text files generated by Windows programs, you ’ll probably want to replace the
sequence 
’\r\n’ with a single newline. Similarly, if your program writes text files that must be read by
Windows programs, replace lone newline characters with ’\r\n’ combinations. You must do this
whether you use the low-level I/O calls presented in this appendix or the standard C library I/O functions.
Listing B.4 provides a simple demonstration of read.The program prints a hexadeci-
mal dump of the contents of the file specified on the command line. Each line displaysthe offset in the file and the next 16 bytes.

do {
/* Read the next line’s worth of bytes.  */bytes_read = read (fd, buffer, sizeof (buffer));/* Print the offset in the file, followed by the bytes themselves.  */printf (“0x%06x : “, offset);for (i = 0; i < bytes_read; ++i)
printf (“%02x “, buffer[i]);
printf (“\n”);/* Keep count of our position in the file.  */offset += bytes_read;
}while (bytes_read == sizeof (buffer));/* All done.  */close (fd);return 0;
}
Here’s hexdump in action. It ’s shown printing out a dump of its own executable file:
% ./hexdump hexdump0x000000 : 7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x000010 : 02 00 03 00 01 00 00 00 c0 83 04 08 34 00 00 00 0x000020 : e8 23 00 00 00 00 00 00 34 00 20 00 06 00 28 00 0x000030 : 1d 00 1a 00 06 00 00 00 34 00 00 00 34 80 04 08 ...
Y our output may be different, depending on the compiler you used to compile 
hexdump and the compilation flags you specified.
B.1.5 Moving Around a File
A file descriptor remembers its position in a file.As you read from or write to the filedescriptor, its position advances corresponding to the number of bytes you read orwrite. Sometimes, however, you ’ll need to move around a file without reading or writ-
ing data. For instance, you might want to write over the middle of a file withoutmodifying the beginning, or you might want to jump back to the beginning of a fileand reread it without reopening it.Listing B.4 Continued16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 288
289 B.1 Reading and Writing Data
The lseek call enables you to reposition a file descriptor in a file. Pass it the file
descriptor and two additional arguments specifying the new position.
nIf the third argument is SEEK_SET ,lseek interprets the second argument as a
position, in bytes, from the start of the file.
nIf the third argument is SEEK_CUR ,lseek interprets the second argument as an
offset, which may be positive or negative, from the current position.
nIf the third argument is SEEK_END ,lseek interprets the second argument as an
offset from the end of the file.A positive value indicates a position beyond theend of the file.
The call to 
lseek returns the new position, as an offset from the beginning of the file.
The type of the offset is off_t . If an error occurs, lseek returns -1.Y ou can ’t use
lseek with some types of file descriptors, such as socket file descriptors.
If you want to find the position of a file descriptor in a file without changing it,
specify a 0 offset from the current position —for example:
off_t position = lseek (file_descriptor, 0, SEEK_CUR);
Linux enables you to use lseek to position a file descriptor beyond the end of the file.
Normally, if a file descriptor is positioned at the end of a file and you write to the filedescriptor, Linux automatically expands the file to make room for the new data. If youposition a file descriptor beyond the end of a file and then write to it, Linux firstexpands the file to accommodate the “gap”that you created with the 
lseek operation
and then writes to the end of it.This gap, however, does not actually occupy space onthe disk; instead, Linux just makes a note of how long it is. If you later try to readfrom the file, it appears to your program that the gap is filled with 0 bytes.
Using this behavior of 
lseek ,i t’s possible to create extremely large files that occupy
almost no disk space.The program lseek-huge in Listing B.5 does this. It takes as
command-line arguments a filename and a target file size, in megabytes.The programopens a new file, advances past the end of the file using 
lseek , and then writes a single
0 byte before closing the file.
Listing B.5 (lseek-huge.c ) Create Large Files with lseek
#include <fcntl.h>#include <stdlib.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>int main (int argc, char* argv[]){
int zero = 0;const int megabyte = 1024 * 1024;char* filename = argv[1];

290 Appendix B Low-Level I/O
size_t length = (size_t) atoi (argv[2]) * megabyte;/* Open a new file.  */int fd = open (filename, O_WRONLY 
|O_CREAT |O_EXCL, 0666);
/* Jump to 1 byte short of where we want the file to end.  */lseek (fd, length - 1, SEEK_SET);/* Write a single 0 byte.  */write (fd, &zero, 1);/* All done.  */close (fd);return 0;
}
Using lseek-huge ,w e’ll make a 1GB (1024MB) file. Note the free space on the drive
before and after the operation.

No appreciable disk space is consumed, despite the enormous size of bigfile . Still, if
we open bigfile and read from it, it appears to be filled with 1GB worth of 0s. For
instance, we can examine its contents with the hexdump program of Listing B.4.
% ./hexdump bigfile |head -10
0x000000 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x000010 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x000020 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x000030 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x000040 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x000050 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ...
If you run this yourself, you ’ll probably want to kill it with Ctrl+C, rather than watch-
ing it print out 2300 bytes.
Note that these magic gaps in files are a special feature of the ext2 file system that ’s
typically used for GNU/Linux disks. If you try to use lseek-huge to create a file on
some other type of file system, such as the fator vfat file systems used to mount
DOS and Windows partitions, you ’ll find that the resulting file does actually occupy
the full amount of disk space.
Linux does not permit you to rewind before the start of a file with lseek .Listing B.5 Continued16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 290

Using open and read, you can extract the contents of a file. But how about other
information? For instance, invoking ls -l displays, for the files in the current direc-
tory, such information as the file size, the last modification time, permissions, and theowner.
The 
stat call obtains this information about a file. Call stat with the path to the
file you ’re interested in and a pointer to a variable of type struct stat . If the call to
stat is successful, it returns 0 and fills in the fields of the structure with information
about that file; otherwise, it returns -1.
These are the most useful fields in struct stat :
nst_mode contains the file ’s access permissions. File permissions are explained in
Section 10.3, “File System Permissions. ”
nIn addition to the access permissions, the st_mode field encodes the type of the
file in higher-order bits. See the text immediately following this bulleted list forinstructions on decoding this information.
nst_uid and st_gid contain the IDs of the user and group, respectively, to which
the file belongs. User and group IDs are described in Section 10.1, “Users and
Groups. ”
nst_size contains the file size, in bytes.
nst_atime contains the time when this file was last accessed (read or written).
nst_mtime contains the time when this file was last modified.
These macros check the value of the st_mode field value to figure out what kind of
file you ’ve invoked stat on.A macro evaluates to true if the file is of that type.
S_ISBLK ( mode)block device
S_ISCHR ( mode)character device 
S_ISDIR ( mode)directory
S_ISFIFO ( mode)fifo (named pipe)
S_ISLNK ( mode)symbolic link 
S_ISREG ( mode)regular file
S_ISSOCK (mode) socket
The st_dev field contains the major and minor device number of the hardware device
on which this file resides. Device numbers are discussed in Chapter 6.The majordevice number is shifted left 8 bits; the minor device number occupies the least signif-icant 8 bits.The 
st_ino field contains the inode number of this file.This locates the file
in the file system.16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 291
292 Appendix B Low-Level I/O
If you call stat on a symbolic link, stat follows the link and you can obtain the
information about the file that the link points to, not about the symbolic link itself.This implies that 
S_ISLNK will never be true for the result of stat. Use the lstat
function if you don ’t want to follow symbolic links; this function obtains information
about the link itself rather than the link ’s target. If you call lstat on a file that isn ’t a
symbolic link, it is equivalent to stat. Calling stat on a broken link (a link that points
to a nonexistent or inaccessible target) results in an error, while calling lstat on such
a link does not.
If you already have a file open for reading or writing, call fstat instead of stat.
This takes a file descriptor as its first argument instead of a path.
Listing B.6 presents a function that allocates a buffer large enough to hold the con-
tents of a file and then reads the file into the buffer.The function uses fstat to deter-
mine the size of the buffer that it needs to allocate and also to check that the file isindeed a regular file.
Listing B.6 (read-file.c ) Read a File into a Buffer
#include <fcntl.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <sys/stat.h>#include <sys/types.h>#include <unistd.h>/* Read the contents of FILENAME into a newly allocated buffer.  The
size of the buffer is stored in *LENGTH.  Returns the buffer, whichthe caller must free.  If FILENAME doesn’t correspond to a regularfile, returns NULL.  */
char* read_file (const char* filename, size_t* length){
int fd;struct stat file_info;char* buffer;/* Open the file.  */fd = open (filename, O_RDONLY);/* Get information about the file.  */fstat (fd, &file_info);*length = file_info.st_size;/* Make sure the file is an ordinary file.  */if (!S_ISREG (file_info.st_mode)) {
/* It’s not, so give up.  */close (fd);return NULL;
}16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 292
293 B.3 Vector Reads and Writes
/* Allocate a buffer large enough to hold the file’s contents.  */buffer = (char*) malloc (*length);/* Read the file into the buffer.  */read (fd, buffer, *length);/* Finish up.  */close (fd);return buffer;
}
B.3 Vector Reads and Writes
The write call takes as arguments a pointer to the start of a buffer of data and the
length of that buffer. It writes a contiguous region of memory to the file descriptor.However, a program often will need to write several items of data, each residing at adifferent part of memory.T o use 
write , the program either will have to copy the items
into a single memory region, which obviously makes inefficient use of CPU cyclesand memory, or will have to make multiple calls to 
write .
For some applications, multiple calls to write are inefficient or undesirable. For
example, when writing to a network socket, two calls to write may cause two packets
to be sent across the network, whereas the same data could be sent in a single packet ifa single call to 
write were possible.
The writev call enables you to write multiple discontiguous regions of memory 
to a file descriptor in a single operation.This is called a vector write .The cost of using
writev is that you must set up a data structure specifying the start and length of each
region of memory.This data structure is an array of struct iovec elements. Each 
element specifies one region of memory to write; the fields iov_base and iov_len
specify the address of the start of the region and the length of the region, respectively.If you know ahead of time how many regions you ’ll need, you can simply declare a
struct iovec array variable; if the number of regions can vary, you must allocate the
array dynamically.
Call writev passing a file descriptor to write to, the struct iovec array, and the
number of elements in the array.The return value is the total number of bytes written.
The program in Listing B.7 writes its command-line arguments to a file using a
single writev call.The first argument is the name of the file; the second and subse-
quent arguments are written to the file of that name, one on each line.The programallocates an array of 
struct iovec elements that is twice as long as the number of
arguments it is writing —for each argument it writes the text of the argument itself as
well as a new line character. Because we don ’t know the number of arguments in
advance, the array is allocated using malloc .16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 293

Linux provides a corresponding function readv that reads in a single operation 
into multiple discontiguous regions of memory. Similar to writev , an array of 
struct iovec elements specifies the memory regions into which the data will 
be read from the file descriptor.
B.4 Relation to Standard C Library I/OFunctions
We mentioned earlier that the standard C library I/O functions are implemented ontop of these low-level I/O functions. Sometimes, though, it ’s handy to use standard
library functions with file descriptors, or to use low-level I/O functions on a standardlibrary 
FILE* stream. GNU/Linux enables you to do both.
If you ’ve opened a file using fopen , you can obtain the underlying file descriptor
using the fileno function.This takes a FILE* argument and returns the file descriptor.
For example, to open a file with the standard library fopen call but write to it with
writev , you could use this code:
FILE* stream = fopen (filename, “w”);int file_descriptor = fileno (stream);writev (file_descriptor, vector, vector_length);
Note that stream and file_descriptor correspond to the same opened file. If you call
this line, you may no longer write to file_descriptor:
fclose (stream);
Similarly, if you call this line, you may no longer write to stream:
close (file_descriptor);
T o go the other way, from a file descriptor to a stream, use the fdopen function.This
constructs a FILE* stream pointer corresponding to a file descriptor.The fdopen func-
tion takes a file descriptor argument and a string argument specifying the mode in16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 295
296 Appendix B Low-Level I/O
which to create the stream.The syntax of the mode argument is the same as that ofthe second argument to 
fopen , and it must be compatible with the file descriptor. For
example, specify a mode of rfor a read file descriptor or wfor a write file descriptor.
As with fileno , the stream and file descriptor refer to the same open file, so if you
close one, you may not subsequently use the other.
B.5 Other File Operations
A few other operations on files and directories come in handy:
ngetcwd obtains the current working directory. It takes two arguments, a char
buffer and the length of the buffer. It copies the path of the current workingdirectory into the buffer.
nchdir changes the current working directory to the path provided as its argu-
ment.
nmkdir creates a new directory. Its first argument is the path of the new directory.
Its second argument is the access permissions to use for the new file.The inter-pretation of the permissions are the same as that of the third argument to 
open
and are modified by the process ’s umask.
nrmdir deletes a directory. Its argument is the directory ’s path.
nunlink deletes a file. Its argument is the path to the file.This call can also be
used to delete other file system objects, such as named pipes (see Section 5.4.5,“FIFOs ”) or devices (see Chapter 6).
Actually,
unlink doesn ’t necessarily delete the file ’s contents.As its name implies,
it unlinks the file from the directory containing it.The file is no longer listed inthat directory, but if any process holds an open file descriptor to the file, the file ’s
contents are not removed from the disk. Only when no process has an open filedescriptor are the file ’s contents deleted. So, if one process opens a file for read-
ing or writing and then a second process unlinks the file and creates a new filewith the same name, the first process sees the old contents of the file rather thanthe new contents (unless it closes the file and reopens it).
nrename renames or moves a file. Its two arguments are the old path and the new
path for the file. If the paths are in different directories, rename moves the file, as
long as both are on the same file system.Y ou can use rename to move directories
or other file system objects as well.
B.6 Reading Directory Contents
GNU/Linux provides functions for reading the contents of directories.Although thesearen’t directly related to the low-level I/O functions described in this appendix, we
present them here anyway because they ’re often useful in application programs.16 0430 APPB  5/22/01  10:58 AM  Page 296
297 B.6 Reading Directory Contents
T o read the contents of a directory, follow these steps:
1. Call opendir , passing the path of the directory that you want to examine.The
call to opendir returns a DIR* handle, which you ’ll use to access the directory
contents. If an error occurs, the call returns NULL.
2. Call readdir repeatedly, passing the DIR* handle that you obtained from
opendir . Each time you call readdir , it returns a pointer to a struct dirent
instance corresponding to the next directory entry.When you reach the end ofthe directory ’s contents,
readdir returns NULL.
The struct dirent that you get back from readdir has a field d_name , which
contains the name of the directory entry.
3. Call closedir , passing the DIR* handle, to end the directory listing operation.
Include <sys/types.h> and <dirent.h> if you use these functions in your program.
Note that if you need the contents of the directory arranged in a particular order,
you’ll have to sort them yourself.
The program in Listing B.8 prints out the contents of a directory.The directory
may be specified on the command line, but if it is not specified, the program uses thecurrent working directory. For each entry in the directory, it displays the type of theentry and its path.The 
get_file_type function uses lstat to determine the type of a
file system entry.

302 Appendix C Table of Signals
SIGINT Linux sends a process this signal when the user tries to end it bypressing Ctrl+C.
SIGILL A process gets this signal when it attempts to execute an illegalinstruction.This could indicate that the program ’s stack is 
corrupted.
SIGABRT The abort function causes the process to receive this signal.
SIGFPE The process has executed an invalid ﬂoating-point math instruc-
tion. Depending on how the CPU is con ﬁgured, an invalid 
ﬂoating-point operation may return a special non-number value
such as inf(inﬁnity) or NaN(not a number) instead of raising
SIGFPE .
SIGKILL This signal ends a process immediately and cannot be handled.
SIGUSR1 This signal is reserved for application use.
SIGUSR2 This signal is reserved for application use.
SIGSEGV The program attempted an invalid memory access.The accessmay be to an address that is invalid in the process ’s virtual mem-
ory space, or the access may be forbidden by the target memory ’s
permissions. Dereferencing a “wild pointer ”can cause a 
SIGSEGV .
SIGPIPE The program has attempted to access a broken data stream, suchas a socket connection that has been closed by the other party.
SIGALRM The alarm system call schedules the delivery of this signal at a
later time. See Section 8.13, “setitimer : Setting Interval Timers, ”
in Chapter 8, “Linux System Calls, ”for information about
setitimer , a generalized version of alarm .
SIGTERM This signal requests that a process terminate.This is the defaultsignal sent by the 
kill command.
SIGCHLD Linux sends a process this signal when a child process exits. SeeSection 3.4.4, “Cleaning Up Children Asynchronously, ”in
Chapter 3, “Processes. ”
SIGXCPU Linux sends a process this signal when it exceeds the limit ofCPU time that it can consume. See Section 8.5, “
getrlimit and
setrlimit : Resource Limits, ”in Chapter 8 for information on
CPU time limits.
SIGVTALRM The setitimer schedules the delivery of this signal at a future
time. See Section 8.13, “setitimer : Setting Interval Timers. ”Table C.1 Continued

Version 2, June 1991Copyright © 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.59 T emple Place –Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license docu-ment, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away y our freedom to share and
change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee yourfreedom to share and change free software —to make sure the software is free for all its
users.This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation ’s
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some otherFree Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General PublicLicense instead.) Y ou can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that youreceive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software oruse pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
1.This license can also be found online at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html .20 0430 APPF  5/22/01  11:02 AM  Page 309
310 Appendix F GNU/General Public License
T o protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.These restrictions translate to certainresponsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,
you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.Y ou must make sure that they,too, receive or can get the source code.And you must show them these terms so theyknow their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you
this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify thesoftware.
Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone
understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modiﬁedby someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have isnot the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reﬂect on theoriginal authors’ reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.We wish to
avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patentlicenses, in effect making the program proprietary.T o prevent this, we have made itclear that any patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modiﬁcation follow.
Terms and Conditions for Copying,
Distribution and Modiﬁcation
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms ofthis General Public License.The “Program,” below, refers to any such program orwork, and a “work based on the Program” means either the Program or anyderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing theProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modiﬁcations and/or trans-lated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limita-tion in the term “modiﬁcation.”) Each licensee is addressed as “you.”
Activities other than copying, distribution and modiﬁcation are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.The act of running the Program is notrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made byrunning the Program).Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
1. Y ou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropri-ately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer ofwarranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence20 0430 APPF  5/22/01  2:41 PM  Page 310
311 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of thisLicense along with the Program.Y ou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may atyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. Y ou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modi ﬁca-
tions or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meetall of these conditions:
na) Y ou must cause the modi ﬁed ﬁles to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the ﬁles and the date of any change.
nb) Y ou must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in wholeor in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, tobe licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms ofthis License.
nc) If the modi ﬁed program normally reads commands interactively when
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use inthe most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including anappropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (orelse, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistributethe program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view acopy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive butdoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on theProgram is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modi ﬁed work as a whole. If identi ﬁable sec-
tions of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonablyconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, andits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separateworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is awork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the termsof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entirewhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights towork written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to controlthe distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program withthe Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storageor distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of thisLicense.20 0430 APPF  5/22/01  11:02 AM  Page 311
312 Appendix F GNU/General Public License
3. Y ou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 aboveprovided that you also do one of the following:
na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readablesource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to giveany third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically perform-ing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corre-sponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to dis-tribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only fornoncommercial distribution and only if you received the program inobject code or executable form with such an offer, in accord withSubsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for makingmodiﬁcations to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface de ﬁnition
ﬁles, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the exe-
cutable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need notinclude anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating sys-tem on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies theexecutable.If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source codefrom the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though thirdparties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. Y ou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License.Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminateyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, orrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated solong as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. Y ou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute theProgram or its derivative works.These actions are prohibited by law if you donot accept this License.Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (orany work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this Licenseto do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe Program or works based on it.20 0430 APPF  5/22/01  11:02 AM  Page 312
313 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.Y ou maynot impose any further restrictions on the recipients ’exercise of the rights
granted herein.Y ou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third partiesto this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or
for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed onyou (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the condi-tions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations underthis License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you maynot distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not per-mit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copiesdirectly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both itand this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particu-lar circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the sectionas a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents orother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this sectionhas the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distributionsystem, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people havemade generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed throughthat system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to theauthor/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through anyother system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a con-sequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder whoplaces the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribu-tion limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted onlyin or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporatesthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar inspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems orconcerns.20 0430 APPF  5/22/01  11:02 AM  Page 313
314 Appendix F GNU/General Public License
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program speciﬁes a
version number of this License which applies to it and “any later version”, youhave the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version orof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Programdoes not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any versionever published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write tothe Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Ourdecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of allderivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of soft-ware generally.
No Warranty
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,THERE
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM,TO THE EXTENT PERMIT-TED BY APPLICABLE LAW . EXCEPT WHEN OTHER WISE STATED INWRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIESPROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS”WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANYKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOTLIMITED TO,THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITYAND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK ASTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM ISWITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,YOUASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SER VICING, REPAIR ORCORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, ORANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTETHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FORDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL ORCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE ORINABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIM-ITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCU-RATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR AFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHERPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HASBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.20 0430 APPF  5/22/01  2:42 PM  Page 314
315 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
End of Terms and Conditions
How to Apply These Terms to Your New
Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to
the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone canredistribute and change under these terms.
T o do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to
the start of each source ﬁle to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; andeach ﬁle should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the fullnotice is found.
one line to give the program’s name and an idea of what it does.Copyright © yyyy name of author
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms
of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation;either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITYor FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General PublicLicense for more details.
Y ou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 T emplePlace–Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in
an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright © year name of authorGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
‘show w’.This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certainconditions; type ‘show c’ for details.
The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the appropriate parts
of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called some-thing other than ‘show w’ and ‘show c’; they could even be mouse-clicks or menuitems—whatever suits your program.
Y ou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample;alter the names:
Y oyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

316 Appendix F GNU/General Public License
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into propri-etary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more use-ful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you wantto do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.
