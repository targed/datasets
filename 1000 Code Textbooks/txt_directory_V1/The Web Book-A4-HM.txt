About The Web Book 
 
If you want to create web sites, there are hu ndreds of books and web pages that claim to 
show you how.  Some of them are very good in deed.  But this book isn’t like all those other 
books and web pages, for a number of important reasons:  
1. The Web Book is an electronic  book, or e-book.  You simply download it as a PDF file 
from www.the-web-book.com  and print it yourself.  Or read it on-screen. 
 
2. The Web Book covers all of the technologies that you need to know in order to create 
Web sites, both using static HTML pages and database-driven sites.  
 
3. Unlike many books on the subject that we re written some years ago, The Web Book 
teaches you up-to-date methods.  Follow the instructions here and you can be 
confident that you’re doing things in the right way, rather than using old-fashioned 
techniques that are now frowned upon. 
 
4. I’ve tried my hardest to keep everything no n-technical.  If you’re "into" computers, 
you should be able to follow everything just fine.  You certainly don’t need to be a 
professional techie.  In fact, if you are, you’ll probably take offence at the way I’ve 
simplified some things.  For which I apologise.   
 
5. If you already look after a web site, perh aps for your school or college, or the 
department you work for, you may be itching to  take your skills to the next level.  Or 
maybe you didn’t actually get much training when you took  on the responsibility, and 
you don’t really understand how everything fi ts together.  In which case, this book is 
perfect for you.  We don’t just tell you to press buttons.  We explain what those 
buttons do, and why you need to press (or not press!) them. 
 
6. Here’s the best bit.   The Web Book is free of charge .  So if you want to teach yourself 
how to do Web stuff, whether for creating your own sites or to make sites for other 
people, just grab a copy of the PDF file , print out the book, and away you go.   
 
One word of warning, though.  Creating a web site and doing it properly isn’t a simple task 
that can be done in an afternoon.  Yes, we’ve all seen 2-page magazine articles that imply 
otherwise, but sadly it’s just not true.  Even at 329 p a g e s ,  t h i s  b o o k  i s  o n l y  a  b a s i c  
introduction to some of the more complex topi cs. It’s quite possible to buy books on HTML, 
CSS, PHP and MySQL which each run to 800 pages. I wouldn’t recommend it, however, unless you have trouble sleeping.

Why We Recommend Hostmonster.com 
 
If you want to create web sites, you need a company to host them for you.  There are 
thousands of such companies out there.  The ex amples in this book are based around one in 
particular, namely www.hostmonster.com .  We chose this company because their 
products appear to be good, and they offer good  value.  They host the site from which you 
will have downloaded this book. 
 
If you’re looking for a web host, we’d love you to use hostmonster because, if you sign up via 
our web site at www.the-web-book.com , we get a small amount of commission.  But the web 
is all about freedom of choice, so if you want to  go elsewhere you’re more than welcome to do 
so.  You’ll need to adapt the examples slightly, but details of any settings or concepts that are 
unique to hostmonster are clearly identified in the text. 
 
If you’re considering using a different host, check our web site first.  There may be a custom 
edition of the book available for that host. We're working on new ones all the time. 
A Custom Edition For Your Company 
 If your company sells web hosting services and you wish to give away or sell copies of this e-
book, we can create a custom version of the book for you, where all the examples feature your 
hosting.  You can then point your customers at our web site to download their copy. 
 
For information on this service, see www.the-web-boook.com/customize.html  or

Who’s Written This Book?  And Why? 
 
The Web Book  is written by Robert Schifreen, a UK-based journalist, writer and technical 
author.  I have more than 25 years’ experience  of writing all sorts of technical articles for 
various computer magazines, and 9 years’ expe rience developing web sites for myself and 
clients.  I’ve also written a "traditional" book before, that was publ ished in 2006 and was 
available as a real hardback in real bookshops.   A Google search for "defeating the hacker" 
will find it for you.  
Having taught web development to the 2,500 staff at a UK-based university for the past few 
years, I thought it might be helpful to turn my  course into a book, wh ich is loosely based on 
the stuff I teach and is also inspired by the qu estions that my students ask.  From now on, 
when people ask me how to create a web site, or  whether it’s easy, I don’t have to spend time 
explaining everything.  I can just say "go to www.the-web-book.com  and download my 
free book, which tells you everything you need to know".

This is the book which I really wish had existe d when I started doing web stuff all those years 
ago.  But, you’re probably asking, why am I giving it away instead of selling it?  There are 3 
reasons. 
 
One.  I quite like the idea of being able to write what I want for a change, without having 
publishers and editors to answer to.  
 
T w o .   I  w a nt  a s  m a ny  p e o p l e  a s  p o ss i b l e  t o  s e e  t h i s  b o o k ,  b e c a u se  I  t h i n k  i t ’ s  u se f u l .   T h e  
trouble with traditional publishing is that, of the hard-earned money that you hand over to 
pay for a copy of a traditional book, most of it  is swallowed up by the publishers and their 
marketing costs.  The author, the guy who sat in front of his PC for months writing the thing, 
typically gets around 15% of your cash. Someti mes less.  So I’ve decided to try something 
different.  This book is free to download and use.  It is financed in 3 ways:  
• If you want to make a small donation via www.the-web-book.com/donate.html  
you're more than welcome. 
• If you run a web hosting company and yo u would like me to produce a custom 
version of the book that features your hosting service, please see the page online at  
www.the-web-book.com/customize.html  for details and pricing.   
• If you want to sign up with  a web host, I'd really appreciate you signing up with 
Hostmonster (who are featured in this edition of the book). Just click the 
Hostmonster icon on www.the-web-book.com/download.php  and everything 
happens automatically.  This brings me a small commission payment, which helps to 
pay for the 5 solid months it took me to write The Web Book.  It won't cost you any 
more, but it means a lot to me. 
 
And the third reason why I'm giving away th e book?  Having been a professional IT 
journalist, editor and writer since 1983, I’ve seen  what the internet is doing to the publishers 
of magazines and books.  Especially those comp anies which produce IT-related publications.   
Computer magazines across the world are being shut down and book sellers are having a 
hard time, because the Web, not the pages of a book, is undoubtedly the best place to find 
information about technical subjects.    
In many cases, those publications shut down  not because the produc t was poor, but because 
the publishers failed to see the internet coming and failed to act accordingly.  Publishers 
need to work with the internet, not against it.  Sure, a search engine means that I can find an 
answer to a technical problem instantly withou t having to plough th rough shelves of books 
and magazines.  But the Web is also the greate st, biggest, best, cheapest and most efficient 
way of copying and disseminating information that ’s ever been invented.  Just ask the music 
i n d u s t ry .   S o  b y  p r o m o t i n g  t h i s  b oo k  o n  t h e  i n t e rn e t  a s  a  f r e e  d o w n l o a d  I  h o p e  t h a t  I  c a n exploit the power of the internet rather  than trying to work against it.

Why We’re Here 
 
No one could have believed, in the last years of the 20th century, that the way we’d all been 
doing Web sites was about to change so dramatic ally.  But it did, in two fundamental ways. 
 
Firstly, Web sites generally consisted of a collection of HTML document files.  Each page of the site was a separate file (don’t worry if you don’t understand much of  what I'm saying here 
- everything will be explained more fully shortl y).   While this works for relatively simple 
sites, with just a few pages, there are better  ways to create web sites.  Using database 
technologies such as MySQL, and programming languages such as PHP, you can create not 
just simple informational web si tes that allow you to publish information, but two-way sites 
that allow your visitors to interact.  Stop th inking "electronic newspaper" and think Facebook 
or Ebay or Amazon. 
 
The second major change was in the fundamen tal way that web pages were structured, in 
terms of layout and formatting.  Font tags gave way to something called CSS, or Cascading 
Style Sheets. 
 In a nutshell, creating web sites has become va stly more complicated ov er the past decade.  
You’ll see from the front cover that this book covers HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and 
MySQL.  If you’re daunted by all that, then don’t be.  We’ll cover everything in a logical 
order, building up your knowledge in layers, so  that all the new material you learn will make 
perfect sense because you’ll be able to see it in context.     You are, of course, free to dip into the book as you wish, reading sections in whatever order 
pleases you.  If you want to know what PHP or MySQL is all about, then by all means skip 
straight to those chapters.  But if you can poss ibly spare the time, you’ll find it much more 
beneficial to read everything in order.  It ’ll make much more sense in the long run.

pages, depending on which hosting package you si gn up for.  Sometimes the figure is as low 
as just one page. 
From Word Processor to Web Site 
 
There's yet another way to create web pages, and that's to write the text with a word 
processor such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice Writer and then use the "save as web page" 
feature to create files which you can put online.  This is often a tempting option, because a) it 
looks to be very easy, and b) lots of people write documents with a wo rd processor and then 
realise that they'd actually quite like to publish them online.  
The trouble is, the "save as web page" feature in Microsoft Word, including the most recent 
version, is horrible.  It produces pages which contain ten times as much information as is 
strictly necessary.  Which means that they'll take  up ten times the space on your server, take 
your visitors ten times as long to download, and cost people ten times as much if they’re 
accessing your site via mobile broadband or  some other metered or pay-per-megabyte 
connection.  Seriously, don't do it. 
 
If you do have some Word documents that you want to put online, there are some excellent 
t h i r d - p a r t y  p r o d u c t s  a v a i l a b l e  t o  d o  t h e  c o n v e r s i o n  f o r  y o u .   M y  f a v o u r i t e  i s  " C l i c k  T o  
Convert", which is what I used to create the we b-based preview version of this book.  All of 
the pages at www.the-web-book.com/preview.php  were generated automatically by 
Click To Convert. 
 
If you’ve bought a hosting package and a domain  name, and you’re not quite sure what to do 
with it, one of the quick-start pages as mentioned above is better than nothing at all.  But if 
you really want to make the most  of the web, there really is no  substitute for learning how to 
do it properly, and that’s what you’ll do if you continue reading. 
But How Long will All This Take? 
 I do hope that you decide to read this book a ll the way through, and follow the examples in it.  
Remember that this is a textbook rather than a novel.  By all means read through it in a day 
or two, but you won’t get the best from it.  For that, you need to work through it gradually, at 
your computer, following the examples.  You shou ld allow a week or 2, at least, to get the 
greatest benefit.  Maybe even a little longer if you want to experiment further, and enhance 
some of the examples with your own ideas.

What Is a Web Site Anyway? 
 
A web site is, traditionally, a coll ection of pages of information.   Creating a web page is, in 
many ways, very similar to writing a letter wi th a word processor and saving it on your 
computer, but there are a couple of important differences.  First, you have to save the page in a specia l format (ie, language) known as HTML, rather 
than as a normal document.  HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  Why hypertext? That’s the name given to the way th at we move between web pages by clicking on 
h y p e r l i n k s  ( t h o s e  b i t s  o f  t e x t  w h i c h  a r e  n o r m a l l y  i n  b l u e  a n d  u n d e r l i n e d ) .   A  m a r k u p  
language is just a way of "marking up" text to  specify that, for instan ce, when the visitor to 
our site clicks on Home
 he gets taken to the home page. 
 
T h e  r e a s o n  w e  h a v e  t o  s a v e  o u r  p a g e s  i n  H T M L  f o r m a t ,  r a t h e r  t h a n  a s  W o r d  d o c u m e n t s ,  
Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, Zip files, etc etc, is that the way we read web sites is with a 
program called a web browser.  For example, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Google 
Chrome, or Opera.  The only type of information that web browsers are guaranteed to be able 
to display are HTML files.  Sure , if you put a Word document on your web site, or a PDF file, 
some web browsers might make a good stab at di splaying the file.  But it’s never guaranteed 
to work.    
The second difference between creating web pages and writing a letter is that, having created 
your web page, you obviously need  to save it.  But rather than saving on your own computer, 
where only you can see it, you need to save it onto a web server.  A web server is simply a 
normal computer, connected to the internet, which runs a web server program.  This 
program means that other people's computers ac ross the internet can connect to it, request a 
copy of your page, and display it. 
 
In theory, any computer that has a permanent connection to the internet can be turned into a 
web server.  Just install the necessary software, which is easily available free of charge, and 
the job is done.  However, hackers love breaking into web servers and crashing them, or 
trying to change the contents of the pages they store.  So unless you really know what you’re 
doing, it’s much easier and safer to rent some space on someone else’s web server to store 
your web sites, rather than running your own serv er.  It’s very cheap to do, as we’ll discover 
later. 
How the Web Works 
 
It’s useful at this point to ou tline, in very basic terms, just  how the World Wide Web actually 
works in practice.  What really happens when you turn on your computer, open up your web

browser and type www.the-web-book.com  into the address bar?  How does the 
information get onto your screen?  And where does it come from in the first place? 
 As I mentioned above, a web page is a document file, stored on a web server,  created with a 
program that’s a bit like a word  processor but which saves its files in HTML format.  When 
you open up your web browser and type www.the-web-book.com , your computer connects 
via the internet to a large, centralised directory in order to find out where the www.the-
web-book.com  site is stored.  This directory is called a DNS Server.  DNS is the Domain 
Name System, which gives each web server (or rath er, each site) a unique name.  In this case, 
the-web-book.com.  Computers, of course, don’t like names.  They prefer numbers.  In the 
case of the internet, each web server has a unique number known as an IP address.  So the 
DNS directory allows your computer to look up  the IP address of the server which holds the 
the-web-book.com  site.   
 Once your computer knows the IP address of  the web server which holds the site, your 
computer can then connect, again over the inte rnet, directly to that server.  Your web 
browser sends a request to the web server, asking for a specific page of the site.  The server 
sends that page (or, if no specific page is spec ified, it sends the home page).   Your browser 
then displays the contents of th at page, and the process is complete.  At least, until you click 
on a link in order to see another page, and the process starts all over again. 
Domain Names 
 So how do new internet domain names get created?   Or to put it another way, how do you get 
the name of your site into that master DNS directory?  It’s a relatively straightforward process.  
Let’s imagine that you want to set up a brand ne w web site from scratch.  The first thing you 
need to do is to think of a name for your site.  For this example, we’re going to start selling 
hamster wheels online.  We need a web site, and we want to call it  
www.hamsterwheels.com .  To create a new web site name, and add it to the global DNS 
directory, we need to call upon the services of a domain name registration company.  There are thousands of such companies, any of whic h will sell you an entry in the global DNS 
directory.  Prices vary, but they’re all selling yo u the same service, so shop around and find a 
registrar that you’re happy to deal with.  
It’s easiest if the registrar is based in your own country, but it’s not essential.  If you don’t 
know where to find such a company, type "domai n name registration" into Google or look at 
the adverts in your favourite computer magazine.

For this example, we’ll use a UK-based registration company called 123-reg.co.uk.  Once you 
surf to their web site you’ll see the following: 
  
 
 In the centre of the screen, under "domain search", you can type in the name of the domain 
you want to register.  Although there are thou sands of domain name registration companies 
around, they’re all selling space in the same, sing le global directory, and you can only register 
a name if no one else has already registered it.  So the first step is to see if our required hamsterwheels.com name is still available.  We type hamsterwheels into the domain search 
box, and the results come back a few seconds later:

It’s bad news.  The hamsterwheels.com name is already taken, so we can’t register it.  We 
could, though, register hamsterwheels.co.uk or hamsterwheels.eu, or any of a whole host of 
alternatives (many more than fit on the picture above).  Alternatively, we could try searching 
for variations, such as hamster-wheels.com or wheels4hamsters.com.    
 Those 2 or 3 letters at the end of the domain na me are important.  They say a lot about your 
domain.  Generally, .com  sites are international in nature , or US-based.  Sites ending in 
.co.uk are used by companies which are primarily based in the UK.  Similarly, there’s a domain for Germany (.de), France  (.fr), New Zealand (.co.nz), and every single country in the 
world, all of which were assign ed by an official world body called ICANN, the Internet 
Committee for Assigned Names and Numbers.    
There are of course exceptions to the rule th at says most suffixes are country-related.  
Schools, colleges and universities in the US, for example, have .edu (for education) whereas 
similar institutions in the UK use .ac.uk (for  academia) instead.  Charities and non-profit 
organisations often use .org rather than .c om, to emphasise the fact that they’re not 
commercial.  There’s also .net for internet-related companies, and many more, such as .mobi for mobile communications.  But rules are mostly made for breaking, especially in the area of

find a company that will register the name for y o u .   S o  i f ,  f o r  e x a m p l e ,  y o u ’ r e  b a s e d  i n  
Germany and you want a .es domain name (for Sp ain, ie España), there’s nothing to stop you 
doing so. 
 
The only country not to have its own domain suffi x, as they’re called, is the small Polynesian 
island of Tuvalu.  Having been assigned the suffix of .tv by ICANN, the government of the 
island accepted an offer of many millions of dollars by a Canadian entrepreneur, for the sole 
rights to be able to sub-let .tv domain names to television stations around the world.  So 
whenever you see a TV station whose web site ends in .TV, and you wonder why the 
television industry was given its own internet su ffix, the answer is that it wasn’t given any 
such thing.  
 As you can see, registering a domain name isn’t expensive.  In the example above, 
hamsterwheels.co.uk is £5.98, or around US$10, for 2 years.  You’ ll also notice that you can’t 
buy domain names outright.  You merely rent them for a period of between 1 and 10 years.  
When the registration expires, yo u automatically have first refusal when it comes to renewal.  
If you renew (which means paying  again), the domain name remain s yours.  If you don’t, it 
goes back into the general list, and anyone else can register it.  There is, as you might expect, 
a steady stream of individual s and companies who attempt to make money by renewing 
domains that their owners have forgotten abou t, and then attempting to sell back to the 
previous owners.  
There are pretty strict rules in place to stop you registering a domain name if your primary 
motive is to trick visitors into believing that  you’re someone else.  If the owners of coca-
cola.com forgot to renew their registration, fo r example, and you registered it for yourself, 
there’s every possibility that  Coke would complain to the company through whom you 
registered the domain and ownership would be transferred.  The whole area of dispute 
resolution is, however, plagued with difficulties.   Comrie Saville-Smith,  from Edinburgh, an 
avid fan of the CS Lewis "Narnia" novels, was given the domain name narnia.mobi as a gift 
by his parents for his birthday.  But lawyers acti ng for the estate of CS Lewis complained, and 
Comrie had to hand it back. 
 
My favourite domain name dispute of all time  happened in the very early days of the Web, 
when an enterprising young man registered baa.com and set it up as a web site for fans of 
sheep.  The organisation known as the British Ai rports Authority, then colloquially (and now 
formally) known as BAA, complained, claiming that this was a blatant attempt to extort 
money by selling the domain name for a profit, an d that the registrant had no real interest in 
sheep.  After a protracted legal battle, BAA wo n its case and the world’s sheepophiles had to 
find a new home on the web. 
 
Anyway, assuming that we wa nt to register our hamsterw heels.co.uk domain, all that 
remains is to tick the box on the screen as shown above, provide some valid credit card

details to the company when asked, and the jo b is done.  Within just a few minutes, a 
confirmation email message will arrive. We are now the proud owners, at least for a year or 
2, of an internet domain name. 
 
Having bought the domain name, how can we turn  it into a web site?  There are two options 
but, whichever we choose, the first step is always the same. 
 
A web site consists of two things.  First, the domain name, ie the www.something-or-
other.com  name that someone has to type into their web browser in order to get to the site.  
Second, the site itself, which is  frequently (but not always) a collection of HTML files.   
 
One of the most important steps in creating a new site is creating the link between the 
domain name and the site's files.  This is often referred to as pointing the domain name at 
the site. 
The Simple Option 
 
In the simplest of our 2 methods for turning a domain name into a usable web site, we 
merely register a free account at an existing web space provider such as MySpace, Facebook, WordPress.com, Blogger, Google  Sites, Flickr, YouTube, Goog le Docs, Microsoft’s Windows 
Live Spaces, and so on. 
 
Each of these systems offer you the ability to create content (documents, pictures, text, video etc) that is accessible to everyone (or to whoe ver you want to make them available to) via the 
web.  You don’t need any special software or skills, just a computer with internet access. 
 For example, in the case of hamsterwheels.co.u k, the easy option for creating a simple web 
presence would be:  
1. Register the hamsterwheels.co.uk domain name 
2. C r e a t e  a n  a c c o u n t  o n  a  b l o g g i n g  s i t e  s u c h  a s  www.blogger.com , on which we can 
c r e a t e  s o m e  b a s i c  p a g e s .   W h e n  a s ked to choose an account name, choose 
"hamsterwheels".  Our blog will thus be assigned a URL of something like 
hamsterwheels.blogspot.com.  We could now simply tell people that the address 
(URL) of our site is hamste rwheels.blogspot.com.  But we  have a better plan, which 
will give our site a mo re professional feel. 
3. Point our newly-purchased domain name at ou r blogger.com space.  This is as simple 
as logging into the web site of the comp any from which we purchased the domain 
name and typing hamsterwheels.co.uk into a box on the "where do you want to point 
this domain?" page.

4. Now, whenever anyone types www.hamsterwheels.co.uk  into their web browser, they 
will end up at our new blog. 
 
Having your own domain name for your online presence (eg www.hamsterwheels.co.uk ) 
rather than relying on the one that gets generated for you (ie hamsterwheels.blogspot.com) gives you a valuable amount of extra control that would otherwis e not be available to you.   
 
If you tell all your friends and customers that your web site is at 
hamsterwheels.blogspot.c om, what happens if you subsequent ly decide to move your pages 
to wordpress.com or MySpace?  Answer: Your si te will effectively disappear because existing 
users will no longer be able to find it.  However, if you’ve told everyone that your site is at www.hamsterwheels.co.uk , you won’t 
h a v e  t h i s  p r o b l e m .   F o r  a s  l o n g  a s  t h e  c o n t e n t is held on blogger.co m, that’s where your 
visitors will end up when they type your URL into their browser.  Wh en you move the site 
elsewhere, the visitors will end up at the new loca tion instead.  All you need to do is spend a 
couple of minutes pointing your domain at the new location, and everything then happens 
automatically.  
So, if you’re tempted to start setting up a web site in a low-risk way, and simply get some free 
space on a site such as MySpace or Blogger, it ’s a really good idea to keep the myspace.com 
or blogger.com address private, and register your  own domain name for it instead.  If you do 
this from the start, it’ll only cost a few do llars a year but will mean that you retain the 
freedom to move your hosting whenever you wi sh, without the risk of confusing or losing 
your existing visitors. 
 
On page 33, once we’ve registered our domain name, I’ll show you how to point it at your 
page on Facebook. 
The Flexible Option 
 Instead of pointing your new d o m a i n  n a m e  a t  y o u r  a r e a  o n  a  s i t e  s u c h  a s  M y S p a c e  o r  
Blogger, the "grown-up" option is to create a fully-fledged web site of your own and to point 
the domain name there instead.  To do this, you need to rent some space on a public web server in order to host your site, ie to store your pages.    
It generally makes sense to buy your hosting space from the same company that rents you 
your domain name.  Although it’s not essential, it does keep things simple.  Whenever you 
rent a domain name, the registration compan y will also ask you whet her you want to buy

will be around $5 per year, and the hosting sp ace will be roughly $5 per month (generally 
payable annually in advance). You won’t be able  to run the next Facebook.com on a hosting

For what it's worth, the site from which you downloaded this book runs on a basic hosting plan costing roughly $5 a month, and copes just fine. 
 
Here’s a screen shot from 123-reg.co.uk, show ing the options available for hosting packages 
to complement our domain name registration.  As  you can see, it’s not expensive.  For less 
than £30 a year, or around $50, you can set up a web site from scratch,  including the domain 
name and the hosting.  Just add some content.  
 
 When you’re buying hosting, the main things to look for are: 
 
1. How much storage space for your site’s co ntent do you get?  Some companies only 
g i v e  y o u  a  m e a s l y  1 0 0  M B  o r  s o ,  w h i l e  o t h e r s  o f f e r  u p  t o  1 0  G B  o r  1 0 , 0 0 0  M B .   
Others offer unlimited storage. 
2. How much data transfer do you get?  That is, the traffic that flows between your web 
site and your visitors’ comput ers.  If you have a page on your server that takes up 
100 KB of storage, and 750 people look at the page each month, that’s 75000 KB or

75 MB of traffic each month.  If the page contains a picture in JPG format that’s 210 
KB, that’s an additional 210 KB of transfer each time.  So you’ll want to make sure 
that the amount of data transfer offered by your hosting company is sufficient for 
your needs. 
3. What other facilities do you need, and are they included in the price?  In our case, for developing the sites covered in this book, we’re going to need the PHP programming language and the MySQL databa se server.  Most hosts offer this, but 
not all of them do.  And in some cases yo u have to pay extra (maybe $1 or 2 per 
month). 
 
As you’ll see, hosting companies offer dozens of additional features that may or not be useful 
to you.  Some offer 100 FTP accounts, for exampl e, allowing up t0 100 different people to be 
able to upload pages to your site, each with their own userna me and password.  Unless you’re 
a multinational organisati on, this is unnecessary. 
 Equally, every hosting company will offer you a number of email inboxes associated with 
your new domain name.  In my opinion, it's easiest not to bother with them. Instead, create one or more email forwarding entries instead (these are free), to forward incoming email from your domain to, say, hotmail or gmail. Or to your existing email account. 
 
Assuming you get your hosting space and your  domain name from the same company, the 
process of setting up a Web site from scratch goes like this: 
 
1. Register the domain name online, and tick the box to say that you want hosting space 
too. 
2. You’ll receive a confirmation email that cont ains two sets of important information.  
First, how to log into the domain name control panel in order to point the domain 
name at your hosting space.  Second, the necessary passwords etc that you’ll need in 
order to upload the HTML files, pictures, and all the other files that comprise your 
new site, onto the server space that you’re  renting.  I call those passwords etc the 
"Fundamental Four", for reasons th at will be explained shortly. 
 
As for the information on how to point your doma in name at the server space, you can ignore 
it for now.  Because you bought the domain name and the server space from the same 
company, this step will already have been done for you.  All you need to do is to start creating 
some content for your web site and then upload it  to the server.  As soon as you start to do 
this, your web site will begin to take shape.  And in the remaining chapters of this book I’ll 
show you how to do just that. 
 As for those fundamental four pieces of informat ion that allow you to upload content to your 
hosting space, what are they?  They comprise:

1. The address of the web server 
2. A username for connecting to the web server 
3. A password to accompany the username 
4. Details of which particular folder or directory you need to upload your files into. 
About Web Content 
 
Having rented some space on a web server, you can now get to work on the ongoing task of 
creating, and maintaining, the content of your site.  There are 3 ways to do this. 
 
1. Install some ready-made software  
There are plenty of web site management system s available, both commercially and as free 
downloads, which you can install on your new ho sting space and which will fulfil some or all 
of your needs.  If you want a web site that wo rks like a blog, which you can log into and post 
new content via a web browser, you need to be  looking for a CMS, or Content Management 
System.   In the world of free software, the leaders in this area are Joomla, Drupal and 
WordPress.  Just download the software from the web, install it on the hosting space that 
you are renting, and you’re ready to roll.    If you want additional features such as picture galleries, real-time chat, etc etc, there are add-
on modules for most CMSes that provide such things. 
 If this sounds like the way you w a n t  t o  m o v e  f o r w a r d ,  y o u  m a y wish to skip the next few 
chapters and go directly to page 118. 
 2. Develop a Database-Driven Site with a WYSIWYG Tool 
 
The second way to create a working site within your hosting space is to use a product that lets you use drag-and-drop, and point-and-cl ick features to design your own CMS-based 
system, which the tool then turns into a number  of custom-written programs and databases 
f o r  y o u  t o  u p l o a d  t o  y o u r  h o s t i n g  s p a c e .   I f  y o u  w a n t  t o  g o  d o w n  t h i s  r o u t e ,  t h e  l e a d i n g  commercial product is Adobe Dreamweaver, which is supremely powerful and 
correspondingly expensive.  If you want do buil d your web site in this way, much of what 
follows is not for you.  Instead, go buy a Drea mweaver book, or look on  Adobe’s web site for 
some tutorials. 
 
3. Create The Site Yourself  
The third option, and the one which gives you the most power and flexibility, is to create the 
web site yourself.  This means starting off by creating a fe w simple pages using HTML, and

subsequently progressing to using database te chniques with PHP and MySQL.  If you choose 
this method, you can make your web site do anything you want.  It’s the way that most 
professional web developers work. 
 
Don’t worry if you’re not an experienced prog rammer or designer.  The programming side, 
with PHP, isn’t particularly difficult.  And ther e are loads of great web sites with ready-made 
page designs that you can use for free. 
 
If this sounds like the way you want to do web stuff, everything that follows is most definitely 
for you.  We’ll start with the basics of HTML and CSS to create simplew web pages, and then 
move on to techniques such as web-based programming with PHP in order to create dynamic 
Web-2.0 online applications. 
Do you need a development server? 
 
In order to create web sites, you need to store the content of your site on a web server.  If 
you’re renting some hosting space, you already have a perfectly usable web server for your 
site.  So, is it OK to use that server during th e development process, for testing your site as it 
takes shape and for storing pages that may not be quite finished? 
 
Chances are, yes it’s perfectly OK.  There’s no ha rm in using your "live" hosting space, or part 
of it, as a test bed for an unfinished site.  And there’s certainly no need to set up a completely 
separate web server, accessible only to  you, for development purposes.   
 
However, setting up a test server might occasionally be required.  For example, if you’re 
working on a new business idea that you hope will make you rich, you really don’t want half-finished pages appearing on a publicly accessible si te before the project is officially launched.  
Also, if you’re working on a particularly co mplex piece of programming, which might crash 
the server if it doesn’t work, you don’t want to  risk damaging a working site that is already 
being used by existing clients.  
 
In such cases, you might want to consider setting up a test web server for development 
purposes.  Also, setting up such a server is a fun thing to do, which can teach you a lot about 
how web sites and the internet work. 
 To find out how to set up a test web server, step by step, refer to Appendix A on page 319.

Getting Everything Together 
 
You should now know all about domain names, web hosting, HTML files, and uploading.  
With this knowledge, you can now create your first web page.  This means creating an HTML 
document file and uploading it to the hosting space on a web server. 
 
Throughout this book, for all of the example web content we create, we’ll need some hosting 
space on a server somewhere.  As I mentioned, there are thousands of companies that will 
rent you space on their servers.  In this book we’ll use a US-based organisation called hostmonster for the examples.  If your hosting is  with someone else, that’s no problem – they 
all work in roughly the same way.  
So having acquired some server space, what’s next?  To create web pages and upload them to 
a web server you’ll need some suitable software  installed on your computer.  First, you’ll 
need an HTML editor.  This is a program whic h works much like a word processor, but which 
saves the finished document in HTML format (ie, as a web page) rather than as a Word or 
RTF file.  Second, you’ll need a program which can upload (ie, copy) HTML files across the 
internet from your computer to the web server.  The standard method for doing this is called 
the File Transfer Protocol, or FTP.  
 
There are many HTML editors on the market.  Some are expensive, complicated commercial offerings such as Dreamweaver from Adobe or Expression Web from Microsoft.  There are 
also some free ones, such as nVu, Amaya and Kompozer, which you can download from the 
internet.  Similarly, there are lots of commercial FTP programs such as ws_FTP (the market leader), and free ones such as FileZilla.  Most commercial HTML editors, such as 
Dreamweaver, also have FTP capability built in, but the free ones tend not to. 
 If you subscribe to a computer magazine that has a monthly CD or DVD on the cover, check 
your collection of discs.  Yo u may find that there’s one or more HTML editors on them, 
which you could consider using.  
Microsoft and Adobe offer time-limited trial versions of their software which you can 
download from their respective web sites.  While products such as Expression Web and 
Dreamweaver are certainly powerful, they’re also confusing for beginners so I’m not going to 
suggest you use them for now.   
 If you already have an HTML editor or an FTP program installed, feel free to use it for all of 
the examples in this book.  If you don't have one, I'll assume that you’d rather use a free one 
than have to buy something. That goes for all the software mentioned in this book.  
Everything that we’ll be using is completely free.

For editing our HTML files we’ll use Amaya an d for our FTP uploads we’ll use FileZilla.  
These are, in my opinion, the best of the freebies. 
 So before you progress to the next ch apter, here’s what you need to do. 
 
1. If you haven’t already regist ered a domain name and bought some hosting space for 
it, now is the time to do so.  For the examples in this book we’re using the services of 
www.hostmonster.com , but other companies are also available.  A Google search for 
"web hosting" will get you started. 
2. Make sure you have the details to hand of  how to access your hosting space.  You 
should know the address of the server, the folder to upload files to, and a username and password. 
3. Download and install Amaya on your computer. This is your HTML editor. 
4. Download and install FileZilla on your computer.  This is the FTP program for uploading finished pages to the server. 
 
The following chapters will ex plain how to do all this. 
 
It’s assumed that you’re working on a Windows computer, using XP, Vista or Windows 7.  
Apologies to those of you who prefer Apple Macs , but this book isn’t compatible with your 
alternative lifestyle and I have no plans to produce a Mac version.

Domain Name and Hosting 
 
The first stage in creating a new public web site is to register the domain name and rent some hosting space, so let’s do th at now.  Let’s sign up at www.hostmonster.com , and register the 
domain called www.the-web-book.com .  That's the domain that I'll be using for all the 
examples that follow. Obviously you'll need to substitute the-web-book.com for whatever domain you decide to register. 
 
Incidentally, a minor technical point that’s wort h knowing at this point.  We won’t actually 
be registering www.the-web-book.com  but merely the-web-book.com .  That’s the way 
that DNS works.  You register  the top-level name, such as the-web-book.com  or 
fabnews.co.nz .   H o w  t o  h a n d l e  p r e f i x e s  i s  t e c h n i c a l l y  u p  t o  y o u ,  b u t  i n  p r a c t i c e  i s  
automatically handled by your hosting company.  You could, if you wish, change the prefix 
from www to web.  Or configure things so that www.yoursite.com  ends up at one place 
but web.yoursite.com  ends up somewhere else. Not that  you’d do that, because it would 
confuse people, but it’s possible. 
 
These additional prefixes are called subdomains , and can be useful in some circumstances.  
The BBC’s news pages, for example, are at news.bbc.co.uk  whereas its main site is 
www.bbc.co.uk . Creating subdomains isn’t something that we’ll cover again in this book, 
but most hosting companies support the facility if you particularly need to do it in the future.  
Right, back to hostmonster.com.  Let’s start by registering our name.

We enter the domain name we want to register, and allow hostmonster to check whether it’s 
available. 
 Note the option for privacy.  There’s a public directory of internet do main name registrations 
that allows anyone to find out the name and address of the person or organisation which 
registered any domain.  It’s known as the "who is" system.  By select ing the privacy option, 
which all domain name registration companies o ffer in one form or another, your personal 
name and address are withheld from the director y.  Unless you’re a large company, you’ll 
probably want to do this. 
 
Our domain name is available, so let’s sign  up and buy it, along with the basic hosting 
package so we get some space on the server for our web content.  We’ll need to supply our 
credit card details and an email address, and also choose a password for logging into the 
control panel. 
 
 
 And we’re done.  That’s all there is to it.  We’ve now set up the required infrastructure for a 
brand new web site.  We’ve got a name, and some  space on which to host the site.  All we 
need to do now is wait for the email message with details of how to connect to our hosting 
space.    
After a few minutes, it arrives.   Here’s what it looks like:

 Having bought some hosting space, the only wa y you’ll ever log into the hosting company’s 
systems is via FTP in order to upload files.  Bu t all hosts also offer a control panel of some

If you’ve not seen a web control panel before, it  probably looks rather daunting.  Especially 
when you see that there are 8 tabs/sections and our screen shot shows just one of them.  The 
good news is that you’ll hardly ever need to to uch it.  But the other good news is that, should 
you ever need to change anything about the wa y your web hosting works, it can all be done 
via this control panel.  One word of advice, though: each time you change something on the 
control panel, make a note somewhere.   It'll come in useful one day.  
 Let’s take a brief look through some of the most important sections of this control panel.  The 
design of which, incidentally, is  not unique to hostmonster.  It’s a commercial product called 
cPanel, which many hosting companies buy becaus e it saves them having to write their own. 
 
Stats 
The area down the left hand side of the screen is your web site dashboard.  It shows you how 
much storage space and transfer capacity you’ re using, when the hosting account expires, 
and so on.  There’s also a link to the Service Stat us page.  If you ever find that your web site 
isn’t working properly, check this page before a ssuming that it’s your fault. The server may 
be down for maintenance. 
 
Partners/Promotional 
This section shows various additional services that you can sign up for, some of which are 
free. Feel free to click on the links and explore further.  But none of these services is 
essential, at least for the time being, so don’t bother signing up for anything unless you really 
want to.  It’ll only complicated things further on. 
 
Mail 
From here you can set up the way that emai l works for your domain.  When you buy a 
domain name, you have control not only over the website at www.yourdomain.com , but 
also any email sent to anyone@yourdomain.com .  At some point we’ll need to configure 
t h i s ,  b e c a u s e  w e  w a n t  t o  e n s u r e  t h a t  m a i l  s e n t  t o ,  s a y ,  info@my-web-book.com  actually 
ends up somewhere where we can access it.  Equally, we want to be able to send mail which 
appears to have come from someone@my-web-book.com .  But for now, this can wait.  We 
need to get the web site up and running first. 
 
Files 
The Files section of cPanel lets you browse and back up the files on your site, ie the HTML 
documents that comprise your web pages.  It’s simplest to do this via an FTP program rather 
than the web control panel, though, so my  advice is to ignore this feature.  
 
Logs 
I t ’ s  u s e f u l  t o  k n o w  h o w  m a n y  p e o p l e  h a v e  b e e n  l o o k i n g  a t  y o u r  w e b  s i t e .   A l l  w e b  s e r v e r s

logs.  One of the friendliest log viewers is webalizer which, as you can see, has been installed 
on the server for us.  To view the logs we need do nothing more than click on the link.  We’ll 
talk more about logs, and how to market your web site, in a later chapter.  
For now, though, click on Choose Log Programs and make sure that Webalizer is enabled. 
That way, when you come to the chapter on how to  look at the stats for your site, there will be 
some nice Webalizer graphs to look at.  If  you don't tick this option, there won't be, 
 
Security 
These options allow you to add security to yo ur web site.  You can add password protection 
to some or all of your pages, or prevent access to your site from certain IP addresses.  Leech 
Protect  adds additional protection to password-protected areas of your site, by allowing you 
to specify how many different IP addresses a particular password is permitted to be used 
from.  This prevents misuse of your site ca used by passwords to protected areas becoming 
known and being distributed among hackers.  We’ll cover web site security, and how to 
protect the information on your site, in much more detail in a later chapter.  Generally, 
protecting your web site is something you do within the site itself, rather than from a control panel.  
Domains 
This area of the control panels lets you mana ge the domain names that you have registered 
via the hosting company.  You can transfer thei r registration to a different company if you 
wish, or move other domains that you own from  a different hosting company to this one.  
You can also create subdomains, as mentioned on page 27. 
 
Databases 
In later chapters, we’ll set up MySQL databases on the server and then create web sites that 
can access them.  From this section of the co ntrol panel you can manage those databases. 
 Software/Services This section allows you to change the way that certain key software applications on the server 
work.  For example, you can change the master configuration file for the PHP programming language if you need to  tweak certain settings. 
 
Advanced 
Among the options available here are "cron jobs".  Most web servers, including this one, use the Linux operating system rather than Windows, and a cron job is the Linux equivalent of 
what Windows refers to as a scheduled task.  This is a way for you to tell the server to 
automatically run a specific program at spec ified times throughout the day, week, month 
and/or year.  You might, for example, set up a cron job that runs a PHP program on the first 
day of every month, which checks the membersh ip database of your web site and sends an 
email reminder to everyone whose subscription to the site is about to expire.

It’s Not Rude to Point 
 
Earlier on, I mentioned that the easiest way to get a professional-lookin g web presence is to 
register your own domain name but, instead of buying hosting space and spending time 
creating pages, just point the domain name at your personal area on a site such as MySpace, Blogger.com, Youtube, Facebook etc.  Now that we’ve registered our domain name, I can 
show you how to do just that.  
First, make sure you know the web address (URL ) of the site that you want to point, or 
redirect, your domain name to.  In this example I’m going to point  www.the-web-
book.com at my page on Facebook, to make up fo r the fact that I haven't created any web 
content for my new domain yet. 
 Log into the web control panel.  If you're using cPanel, you need the Domains section.  
Specifically the option called "Redirects", wh ich brings up a page that includes a section 
which looks like this: 
 
 
 
As you can see, I’ve typed (actually, pasted) the address of my Facebook page into the 
"redirects to" box.  I’ve also selected the-web-book.com  as the source. 
 
That’s all you need to do.  Click the "Add" button, wait a few seconds for your server to 
update itself, and the job is done.  If I now open my web browser and attempt to surf to 
www.the-web-book.com , I actually end up at my Facebook page instead.  
 Obviously, if you’re intending to go down this route from the start, there’s no need to pay for hosting space when you register your domain na me.  Indeed, you can stop reading this book 
now, as we’ve covered everything you need to k n o w .   H o w e v e r ,  w i t h  so many good offers 
around for combined registration and hosting, you may decide that it’s  easier to just buy 
both at the same time, even if you start off by pointing your domain name  at an external site 
for the first few months rather than creating your own content.

If you really do want to regist er just a domain name and have no intention of occupying any 
hosting space, most hosting companies offer this service.  They all offe r redirect facilities, 
too, so that you can point your new name wherever you wish.

HTML Editor and FTP Client 
 
With our hosting space now purchased but sitting  empty, we need some programs that will 
let us start to fill it.  This means an HTML editor to create pages, and an FTP program to 
upload those pages to the server. 
 FTP programs come in two flavou rs, namely clients and servers.  For copying files between 2 
computers, you need a client.  An FTP server is what the web server runs, allowing clients to connect to it.  Don’t mistakenly install an FT P server on your computer, as it will allow 
everyone in the world to attemp t to connect to your computer via the internet and copy files 
to or from your computer.  
There are plenty of free HTML editors available for Windows, and the one we’ll be using 
throughout this book is Amaya.  It's relatively easy to use and, unlike some of the other free 
programs, doesn’t attempt to install additional spyware or toolbars that you don’t need.  
There are many free FTP clients available.  One of the most popular is Filezilla, so that’s what 
we’ll use. 
Amaya 
 
To download Amaya, visit http://www.w3.org/Amaya  and follow the Distributions link 
to reach the download page.  It doesn’t matter whether you get the http or FTP version – the 
programs are both the same, the only diffe rence is how your computer performs the 
download. 
 
New versions of Amaya are released every 4 months or so.  The examples in this book are 
based on version 11.2, released in mid-2009.  
Once you’ve downloaded the Amaya program and saved it to your computer, double-click the 
file to start the installation process.  Keep clicking Next to accept the suggested options, and 
the installation will complete.  The installe r will add an icon to your Windows desktop, 
making it easy to run the program whenever you want. 
Make A Web Work Folder 
 Now is a good time to give a moment’s th ought about where you wa nt to store work-in-
progress web pages on your computer.  When yo u’re creating web content, such as HTML 
files, the normal way of working is to create and edit the files on your computer, and only to upload them to the web server (and thus make  them available to the public) when they’re

finished.  This has a number of advantages.  Primarily, it means yo u always have backup 
copies of your pages, because there’s the version on the server and the version on your PC.  
Also, it means that information which you have n’t finished writing or checking can’t be 
accessed by anyone except you.  If your co mpany is about to launch a new product, for 
example, uploading unfinished, unannounced deta ils on the web site for Google (and thus 
the world in general) to find is unwise.  
You need a folder on your computer to store your web work.  For the purposes of this book, 
I’ll assume that this folder is on your desktop and is called Web Work.  If you want to create 
i t  s o m e w h e r e  e l s e ,  o r  g i v e  i t  a  d i f f e r e n t  n a m e ,  t h a t ’ s  f i n e .   B u t  i f  y o u ’ r e  h a p p y  w i t h  m y  
suggestions, right-click on your desktop and create a new Web Work folder now. 
Filezilla 
 
Visit http://www.filezilla-project.org   to download the FileZilla FTP client.  
Choose the option to download the latest Windows version.  The examples in this book use 
version 3.2.3.1, released in mid-2009, but you may find that  a slightly later version is 
available by the time you read this.   
 
Having downloaded the .EXE file, double-click it to start the inst allation process.  Or if you 
downloaded the .ZIP file, you’ll need to extract it first (right-click the file and choose Extract 
All), and then double-click the extracted installer file.    You might be asked whether to install for all us ers or just for you.  Unless you specifically 
don’t want to do so, choose the "all users" option.  It means th at, if you have multiple user 
accounts on your computer, everyone will be able  to use FileZilla.  (You’ll need to be logged 
into your computer as an administrator to be able to do this "All Users" installation.  If you’re 
not, try the other method.) 
 You’ll then see a list of components that you wish to install, such as icon sets, shell 
extensions and so on.  De-select them all, as th ey aren’t necessary.  But you’ll probably want 
to select the "desktop icon" option in order to  h a v e  t h e  i n s t a l l e r  c r e a t e  a n  i c o n  o n  y o u r  
desktop.  
We now need to configure FileZilla so that it  can connect to your hosting space on the web 
server to upload the files you create.  This requires those "fundamental four" pieces of 
information I mentio ned earlier.   
 
If FileZilla isn’t already started on your comp uter, double-click its de sktop icon to run it. 
You’ll see a screen that looks something like this.

Note the references to Local Site and Remote Site.  The former shows the files on your 
computer, while the latter shows files on the web server.  Or at least, they will when we have 
configured the program. 
 From the File menu, choose Site Manager and then click the New Site button.  Choose a 
name for the server you want to connect to, and press Return.   Web Work is a suitable 
choice, or perhaps use the name of the site you intend to crea te.  FTP programs allow you to 
create multiple connections like  this, each with their own name , so that you can upload files 
to different servers (or different folders on the same server)  if you wish.   
 Having named your connection, look under the General tab and enter the host name.  That’s 
FileZilla’s term for the a ddress of your web server.  In this case, I’ll use the-web-book.com 
because that's what the account information sent  by the hosting company tells me to use.  
Change the Logontype to Normal and enter your server username (thewebbo in my case)  
and password. 
 Now click on the Advanced tab.  In the Defaul t Local Directory box, cl ick the Browse button 
and select the Web Work folder you made earlier.   For the default remote directory, just type 
a / (forward-slash) character. 
 
That’s all there is to it, so click the OK button.   FileZilla is now configured to connect to our 
web server. 
 
We can now test that it works so, from the File menu, choose Site Manager again.  Click on 
the name of your server and then click the Connect button.  After a few moments, you should

be connected.  Depending on how Windows is configured on your computer, you may receive 
a pop-up warning from the Windows Firewall asking if it’s safe to unblock connections to the 
FTP server.  If so, just click on Unblock.  
Assuming that FZ can connect to your se rver, you should see something like this: 
 
 
 
On the left hand side of the screen, under Local Site, you can see the local folder on your

folder, which currently has nothing in it becaus e we haven’t yet created any HTML files.    
 
On the right, the Remote Site column shows the folders and files on your server.  You’ll see 
various folders such as .cpanel, .htpasswds, .ssh and others.  The folder that is of primary 
interest at this point is public _html.  This is where you will put all of the content that makes 
up your web site.  All of the other folders are for use by the web server only, and are not accessible to the general public vi a your web site.  For now, it’s safest to leave them alone and 
not be tempted to explore or delete them. 
 
W i t h  a n  H T M L  e d i t o r  a n d  a n  F T P  c l i e n t  n o w  duly installed and configured, we’re finally 
ready to create web pages.  So close FileZilla and we’ll get started.

Creating Your First Web Page 
 
Time to create a web page.  Start Amaya, and cl ose the tip of the day if one gets displayed. 
 
From the File menu, choose New Document an d you’ll see a box something like this: 
 
 
 
Click the folder icon near the top right hand corner, browse to your Web Work folder and 
click OK.  Amaya will now generate a filename for your new page that ends with New.html, 
but this isn’t what you want.  So change it to index.html, as illustrated above. 
 Why index.html?  Because if someone visits yo ur web site and doesn’t specify a particular 
page that they want to see, the server will sh ow them the home page.  And the way that you 
tell your server which is the home page, is by naming it index.html. 
 
If someone visits your site and explicitly types www.yoursite.com/products.html  into 
their Web browser, the server will send them products.html.  But if they merely type 
www.yoursite.com , the server will attempt to send them index.html.  And if index.html 
doesn’t exist, the visitor will see an "Error 404 – page not fo und" error message.  So, you 
always need to start with index.ht ml when you’re creating a new site, or any  new folder in an 
existing site. 
 
Incidentally, you may have noticed we named ou r page index rather than Index or INDEX.  
This is important.  Generally, you should al ways name web pages in lower case, without any 
CAPITAL LETTERS or spaces.  That’s becaus e most Web servers are case-sensitive, and 
regard Index.html and index.html  as two separate files.  To avoid confusion caused by pages 
not being found because they were typed by the visitor (or specified in a hyperlink) in the 
wrong case, it’s best to standardise on  everything being in small letters.

So, we’ve named our page.  Now choose the "Replace  Current" option, give your page a title, 
and un-tick the From Template box.  Then click Create, and go ahead and type some text 
onto your page.  It’ll look something like this:  
 
 When you’re finished, click File/Save, then File/Exit Amaya.  
 
We’ve now created an HTML file, which should be  in your Web Work folder.  So double-click 
the folder and then double-click the index.html file that’s in there.  The file will open in your 
web browser and should look like this:

Open FileZilla and connect to your server (from the site manager, click your site and then the 
Connect button).  On the left hand side of the screen, in your local area, ensure that 
index.html in the Web Work folder is listed.  On the right hand side, in the Remote Site area, 
double-click the public_htm l folder to open it.   
 
Now double-click the index.html file.  FileZilla wi ll copy it from the loca l folder to the remote

There it is, right at the bottom of the list, after assorted files such as .htaccess, 400.shtml and others. 
 
If your hosting company puts any folders or fi les in your public_html folder, it’s generally 
quite safe to delete them (albeit after a cursory check to ensure they're not vital) if you don’t 
know what they are.  After all, your public_html folder is your public web site, and anything 
in there is accessible to anyone in the world who types the correct filename and site name 
into their web browser.  For now, though, you ca n rest assured that thes e particular files are 
harmless so don’t do anything with them yet. 
 With your index.html file upload ed, you now have a real, live, publicly-available web site.  At 
least, that’s the theory.  To find out for su re, close FileZilla and open your web browser 
(Internet Explorer, Firefox or whatever you prefer).  Type the URL of your site (
www.the-
web-book.com  in our case here) and you should see your page like this:

Now step away from the computer! 
 
O n c e  y o u  k n o w  t h e  b a s i c s  o f  c r e a t i n g  w e b  p a g e s ,  i t ’ s  h u g e l y  t e m p t i n g  t o  p l o u g h  s t r a i g h t  ahead and start creating a complete site.  Althou gh that’s almost certainly what you want to 
do right now, it’s a bad idea for two reasons.  First, although you kn ow the basic method for 
creating pages, there are lots of time-saving techniques that we haven’t covered yet.  Much better to know about them first, before it’s too late to go back and start using them.  Second, 
there’s more to creating web si tes than simply typing text into an HTML editor and hitting 
the Save button.  You need to give some seri ous thought to the design and usability of the 
site, how you’re going to displa y the text, how you’re going to import existing content from 
other documents, and, most importantly, wh o and what your site is actually for. 
 
So if you’re tempted to skip this chapter and get on with building your site, please don’t.  If 
you stop reading now, and start creating your si te, you’ll end up with lots of pages that are 
very difficult to update and which don’t conf orm to recommended standards.  By all means 
create a few test pages, and feel free to keep on experimenting, but please don’t assume that 
there’s nothing else important left to learn. 
 At the very least, please don't start crea ting a site for real until you've read: 
 
1. The remainder of this chapter. 
2. The chapter about CSS, which starts on page 59 . 
3. The introduction to Content Management Systems (CMSes) which starts on page 118. 
 
WWW – What, Why, Who? 
 
Before you start to create a site, it’s vital that you have clear in your mind: 
 
1. What type of site you’re creating. 
2. Why you’re creating the site. 
3. Who the site is for. 
 
What type of site are you creating, and why?  Is  it an information site, where people expect to 
quickly find what they’re looking for and then leav e?   Or is this an entertainment site, where 
visitors browse and read with no particular purpose, and won’t complain if it takes a while to 
find what they’re looking for among all the pretty graphics and animations?

This matters because it will affect the layout of your pages. If you want people to quickly find 
what they’re looking for, your menus need to be clear and concise.  Preferably stick with just 
one (or a maximum of 2) menus on each page.  If  a visitor is looking for your contact details, 
they shouldn’t have to scan 6 different menus.  Ei ther the item is on the menu or it’s not, and 
this should be possible to discover almost instantly. 
 
Equally, keep your menu choices unambiguous and mutually exclusive.  For example, if your 
site is all about vehicles, don’ t have a menu which contains items called "vintage vehicles" 
and "buses".  Or if you’re writing the site  for your company’s HR/Personnel department, 
avoid having menu options called "new staff" and "for managers".  You’ll merely confuse the visitor who’s looking for vintage buses, or th e person who’s a newly-recruited manager.  A 
confused visitor won’t spend time exploring the options – he’ll simply try someone else’s site 
instead, or give up entirely.  Therefore, spend some time planning your menu headings and hierarchy so that the choices are obvious. 
 The best way to plan your layout and menus (navigation) is with pen and paper, or a 
whiteboard.  There’s no need to use a computer at this stage, so put away the PC and start scribbling.  When you have some rough design s, create some PC-based mockups and show 
them to a few people for comment.  Ideally, th ose people should be potential users of your 
site.  There’s no need to create the mockups as proper HTML pages.  Use a graphic editor such as 
Windows Paint, or a spreadsheet, or whatever else you want at this stage.  The pages don’t

can download it for around $50, or use it online for free. Check out www.balsamiq.com  for 
more.  
Put page content where visitors expect to find it. A logo at the top of the page.  Menus on the 
left or across the top.  Main content to the righ t.  Don’t set out to be different – you’ll only 
end up being frustrating. 
Importing Existing Content 
 HTML is the primary document format used for Web pages.  It’s the only one that every Web browser can be guaranteed to read, whether that Web browser is a PC, Mac, mobile phone, 
iPod, PDA, Blackberry, televisi on, or any other device that has built-in internet access. 
 
All of which leaves the question of what to do  with all those existing Word documents, Excel 
spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, PDF files and so on, that you’d like to make 
available online via your Web site.

Generally, you have two choices.  The first option is to upload the files to your site, just as 
you would with any other file such as an HTML  document or a css file. You can then provide 
a link to the .DOC, .XLS, .PDF or .PPT file just  as you would to any other page on your site.  
However, there’s no guarantee as to what will happen when the visitor clicks on the link.  It will depend greatly on which Web browser the visito r is using, whether he left- or right-clicks 
on the link, and what software is already installed on his system.  
 
Among the various things that might happen are:  the browser will open the file and make a 
stab (sometimes a pretty good one, sometimes not) at displaying it; the browser will pass the 
file to another program on th e computer, which will open and display it; the browser will 
complain and do nothing; the browser will offer to save the file to the visitor’s hard disk. 
 
Despite these potential problems, not to mention the fact that non-HTML files aren’t as easy 
for search engines such as Google to find, up loading non-HTML files to Web sites is still 
common practice and may sometimes be the only feas ible option.  Or at least, the only option 
that you have time to implement.  
 The second option is to convert the document to a "proper" Web page, ie to an HTML file.  
This means starting from scratch, copying an d pasting unformatted plain text from the non-
HTML file into your HTML editor (eg Amaya) and then formatting it.   If you have the time, 
this is by far the better route. 
 
One technique which you should definitely avoid is the "save as web page" feature built into 
programs such as Word and Excel.  Although this will produce an HTML file, the conversion 
process is inefficient at best and downright appa lling at worst.  The resulting file will be 
many times larger than a version created by copying and pasting, and probably totally 
unintelligible.  Which ma kes it hard to maintain, and tota lly impossible to apply CSS styling 
to.  This is a classic example of a short cut which will lead to major problems in the long 
term.  Do not be tempted to go down this  route. There's more about this on page 13. 
Writing For The Web 
 
Writing Web pages isn’t like writing printed do cuments, because people read Web pages in a 
different way.  For a start, if a Web page doesn’t provide the reader with the information 
they’re looking for within 5 seconds, they’ll give  up and use Google to find a different site.  
Here are some tips to consider when you’re writing a new Web page or  editing an existing 
one:

1. Think about who you’re writing for.  What so rt of audience?  Youn g or old?  Technical 
or non-technical?  Are they looking for info rmation or entertainment?  Do they want 
a plain, easy-to-read design, or would something more arty appeal? 
2. Don’t start with a long "welcome" intro, saying  what the page is for.  The visitor will 
quickly skim-read the page and make up their own mind as to whether it seems 
suitable.  The quicker they find out, the more chance of them staying around. 
3. Don’t assume that everyone reading your We b site will have an enormous screen or a 
fast internet connection.  They may be br owsing on a mobile phone or PDA, where 
the screen is small and every minute online costs money. 
4. Keep paragraphs short and columns narrow.  It’s much easier to read this way.  Also, 
don’t pack too much information on each page.  Users prefer to click rather than 
scroll. 
5. Line spacing of 1.5 or 2 is good.  Small text with 2.0 line spacing is easier to read than 
large text with 1.0 spacing. 
6. Never use blue or underlined text.  Pe ople will think it’s a clickable link. 
7. Stick to the various conventions, such as a click on your main logo taking readers to the home page.  Someone looking to cont act you will be seeking a "Contact Us" 
button, not something that says "Get in touch". 
8. Don’t arrange text in columns such that th e reader has to scroll the screen up and 
down.  It’s a Web page, not a newspaper. 
9. Don’t waste too much above-the-fold (the area of the screen that can be read without 
scrolling) with waffle or large pictures.  
10. C h e c k  t h e  s p e l l i n g  o f  y o u r  p a g e s ,  b u t  d o n ’ t rely solely on any automatic spelling 
checker. 
Fonts and Colours 
 
Fonts (typefaces) are important.  Sans-serif fonts tend to work best on screen, rather than 
serif fonts.  But don’t use non-standard fonts th at your readers are unlikely to have installed 
on their computer.  You can read more about fonts on page 67. 
 Readers will use your site’s co lour scheme to form a subconscious opinion about you.  When 
did you last see a bank’s Web site that was bright red and yellow?  When did you last see a 
hamburger restaurant site that was dark blue ?  Choose appropriate colours for your pages, 
but don’t go overboard.  And don’t force people to  rely on colours, such as referring in your 
text to "the yellow box", because the visitor mi ght be colour-blind or might be reading your 
page on a black and write printout.

Hyperlinks 
 
Probably the most important concept underl ying the entire World Wide Web is the 
hyperlink.  Those 1 or 2 words, normally in bl ue and underlined, which your visitor can click 
on to move to another page or another site.   Once you know how to create simple web pages, and some hyperlinks to allow your visitors  to move between them, you have the basic 
building blocks for constructing just about any site you could ever need. 
 
Before we can create hyperlinks we’ll need to create a second page for our site to complement our index.html home page.  So fire up Amaya and, using the instructions on page 39, create 
another page in your local Web Work folder.  This time, name it more.html instead of index.html.  With 2 pages created for our site , we can now create some hyperlinks between 
them. 
 
Using Amaya, open your index.html page.  To  do this, go to the File menu, choose Open 
Document, then select File, then browse to th e index.html file in your Web Work folder. 
 E d i t  t h e  p a g e  s o  a s  t o  i n c l u d e  s o m e  t e x t  w h ich will include the clicka ble hyperlink.  Then 
select the actual words that you want to turn into a link, by dragging over them with your 
mouse like this:  
 
 
By selecting the text, we’ve told Amaya which wo rds we want to turn into a hyperlink.  All

and click the Confirm button.    Then click somewhere on the blank white space within your 
index page. 
 Your link is now created, and should appear on your page as underlined text like this: 
 
 
 
You’ve probably noticed my choice of clickabl e text, namely "find out more".  You might have 
expected me to choose "click here" instead.  After all, doesn’t it make sense to always turn 
"click here" or "click this link" into, well, some thing clickable?  Actually, no it doesn’t.    
 One important aspect of web site design is ac cessibility. This means making sure that your 
site can be used fully by those with disabilities .  For example, that bit of text which pops up 
when someone hovers over a picture (in case they can't see the pictures), or visitors being 
able to navigate through your site using keyboard shortcuts rather than a mouse.  Making 
your site accessible is, if nothing else, common sense and a polite thing to do. In many cases, 
depending on which country you’re based in and whether your site is produced by an organisation in the public or private sector, cr eating an accessible site is actually a legal 
obligation and you risk prosecution if di sabled users can’t make full use of it. 
 People who are blind or partia lly-sighted often use screen reader software to help them 
navigate the web. This special software rea ds out the contents of web pages via a voice 
synthesizer.  Having read out the contents of  the page, it will then scan the page for

hyperlinks and read those too, so that the user can press a key as soon as he or she hears the 
particular link they want to visit.  And that ’s the reason why I chos e to highlight the words 
"find out more" rather than "click here".  Becaus e a blind person would much rather listen to 
a list of choices that consisted of "find out more", "go to main menu", "print this page", 
"browse our catalogue" and so on, than a list that said "click here", "click here", "click here", 
"click here" or "click here".  
Anyway, back to our page.  We’ve created a link from our home page to our "more info" page.  
B e f o r e  o u r  f a n t a s t i c  n e w  t w o - p a g e  s i t e  i s  r e a d y  t o  t e s t ,  w e  s h o u l d  a l s o  c r e a t e  a  l i n k  f r o m  
more.html page to the index page.  So close the index page, open the more.html file instead, 
and, using the same process as above, add a line to more.html which says something like 
"click here for the home page".  Then turn "home page" into a clickable link which goes to 
index.html and save the file.  Then quit Amaya. 
 
Before we can test our links, we’ll upload them to the server.  So refer to the instructions on 
page 41 for uploading files, and use FileZilla to upload both index.html and more.html to 
your server.  Finally, close FileZilla and use your  Web browser to surf to  your web site.  Click 
on the links, and you should be able to move  between your two pages.  Isn’t that neat? 
 
Now that you know everything that’s required to  create a simple web si te with links, why not 
try creating a third and fourth page for your site, and set up some more hyperlinks between 
them? 
Linking to Other Sites 
 
The destination for your hyperlinks  doesn’t have to be limited to pages on your own site.  You 
can easily create links to other places.  In the box where you type in the destination for the 
link, just type in the complete address (URL) for the destination site, including the http:// 
part at the start.  Including the http:// is  vital, otherwise external links won’t work. 
 If you want to try this, add a line to one of your web pages that says "You can search the web 
with Google", then high light the word Google and create a link to 
http://www.google.com .  Upload the page to your serv er and check that the link takes 
you to Google when you click it. 
Mailto: Links 
 
Here’s a neat idea that allows people to send you email messages via your web site. 
 
Open one of your web pages (either your home page or more.html) and add a line which says 
"You can send us an enquiry via email if you wish".  Now highlight the phrase "send us an

enquiry" and turn it into a link.  In the Link box, where you normally type the destination 
page, type: 
 
mailto:yourname@yourmail.com?subject=Enquiry 
 
where yourname and yourmail make up  your own personal email address. 
  
Now save the page, upload it, surf to it via your Web browser, and see what happens when 
you click on the link.  Your computer’s defa ult email program will automatically open, ready 
to send a message to the address you specified.   Plus, the subject line of the message will 
already be filled in with the word "Enquiry". 
 This is a simple way to allow visitors to your site to interact with you.  However, there are 
drawbacks.  Primarily, it’ll only  work if the visitor’s computer has been set up to send email, 
and their computer knows which program to open when it encounters mailto: links in Web pages.  Not all computers can handle this, and there’s no way you can anticipate the 
p r o b l e m s .   I n  a  s u b s e q u e n t  c h a p t e r ,  w h e n  w e  come to discuss HTML forms and PHP, I’ll 
show you a much better way of allowing visitors to send messages via your site.  But for now, mailto: links will have to suffice.

Understanding The Basics of HTML 
 
On page 14 I mentioned HTML, the language of the Web.  Or at least, the language that all 
Web pages have to be written in.  I also poin ted out that you don’t have to understand the 
intricacies of HTML, because programs like Am aya automatically generate this special code 
for you.  
However, for reasons that will become appare nt when we start to learn about CSS style 
sheets, you do need to know some HTML.  Th ankfully, the amount you need to know is 
relatively little, and it’s not difficult.  
Let’s take a look at some of the HTML which Amaya has, until now, been hiding from you.  Use Amaya to open your index.html page.  Then, from the Views menu, click on Show 
Source.  The screen will split to  show your page at the top and the HTML code version at the 
bottom.  Use your mouse to drag the dividing line upwards, so you can see more HTML code 
like this: 
 
 
 
Although the code looks daunting at first, two fundamental rules will help you to make sense 
of it. 
 
1. An HTML file contains a mixture of page  content (ie, the words on the page) and 
formatting commands.  Page content appears normally, and Amaya generally d i s p l a y s  i t  i n  b l a c k .   H T M L  f o r m a t t i n g  c o m m a n d s ,  c a l l e d  t a g s ,  a l w a y s  a p p e a r  i n

pointy brackets <like this> and Amaya gene rally displays them in purple, unless you 
change the program’s settings. 
 
 
2. HTML tags generally occur in pairs.  The fi rst occurrence turns on a particular effect, 
or marks the beginning of a particular sect ion.  The second occurrence turns off the 
effect, or marks the end of the section.   The second occurrence uses the same tag 
name as the first, but with a forward-slash at the start of the tag name. 
 
Armed with these two vital facts, you should no w be able to start making sense of the HTML 
code that comprises our page.  There are 2 main sections to the page, namely the head and 
the body.  The head section, which starts with a <head> tag and ends with </head>, contains 
information about the page as a whole.  There’ s a meta-tag called Generator, the value of 
which is Amaya.  This tells anyone who cares to look at the HTML code of your page that it was created with Amaya.  There’s also a head tag called <title> which is where your page’s title gets put.  The page title is what appears in the title bar of the web browser window when 
visitors (or you) look at your site. 
 Some tags don’t actually need a closing tag, ie the version with the forward-slash at the start.  
The meta tag is one such example.  However, recent changes to the HTML specification say 
that all tags must be closed, even those that do n’t officially need to be.  This helps to avoid 
errors on pages, which could confuse some browsers.  Hence the </ > tag, which means 
"close the previous tag". 
  The most common tag that you’ll see on web page s is <p>, which starts each paragraph.  The 
paragraph then ends with </p>,  and then a further <p> tag starts a new paragraph below it.  There are other tags that affect the way that text looks on the page.  For example, the <b> tag 
makes text bold and <i> makes it italic.  To see how these work, click your mouse somewhere 
in the HTML window and then, somewhere within  a paragraph, type <b>.  Then, a few words 
later, type </b>.  Now click back into the top half of the screen, and you’ll see that your 
chosen words are now displayed in bold like this:

One set of tags that you’ll use often are the heading levels.  There are 6 of these tags built into 
the HTML language, which allow you to create headings of up to 6 levels.  Typically, the main 
heading on your page will be a level one headin g, which starts with an <h1> tag and ends 
with </h1>.  You might then want to includ e a sub-heading later on, for which you’d use a 
matching pair of h2 tags.  
Amaya can generate heading tags for you automa tically.  In the top half of the screen, 
highlight the first line and then click the T1 button in the right hand panel.  Then click into 
the lower half of the screen and see how that text is now surrounded by h1 tags like this:

Meta tags 
 
Earlier, I mentioned meta tags.  Specifically the meta-tag with a name of "Generator" and a 
value of "Amaya".  Meta-tags are a way for a we b page to supply inform ation about itself to 
the web browser that is displaying  the page.  One of the most popular uses of meta-tags is to 
include a brief description of the page, and a fe w keywords about it too.  For example, the 
<head> section of an HTML file might contain the following code: 
 
<meta name="description" content="Latest availability for the Grand Hotel"> 
<meta name="keywords" content="availability, late bookings, vacant rooms"> 
 
It's always a good idea to include these two tags (a description and some keywords) on every 
p a g e  y o u  c re a te .   I t  w i l l  h e l p  y ou r  si t e  t o  b e  found and indexed by search engines such as 
Google.  
 
In the past, search engines based the contents of their indexes on little more than this 
information.  However, that's no longer the case, as many web site operators tried to cheat 
the system by, for example, including explicit sexu al keywords to describe fairly dull sites.  So 
although meta-tag information is no longer as important as it was, it is still taken into 
account by search engines as part of a much more complex process. 
 
There's more about this in the chapter on  Search Engine Optimization, on page 313.

HTML Accessibility, Accuracy and Privacy 
 
You maybe surprised to know that anyone, and no t just you, can view the HTML code for the 
web pages you create.  Equally, you can view the HTML code of any page on the Web.  Just 
about every Web browser, including all the leading ones such as Internet Explorer, Firefox 
and Safari, have an option that will show you the source code, as it’s called, of the page you’re 
looking at. 
 
For example, open your web browser and then surf to one of your favourite pages, such as 
Google, Wikipedia, Facebook, or any other page that you prefer.  If you’re using Internet 
Explorer, bring up the View menu (press the alt key to show the menu bar if it’s not 
displayed) and then choose View Source.  All other browsers have a similar option, either 
from the menu line or via a right-click.  You’ ll then see the HTML so urce code of the page. 
 
This total lack of privacy has two implications.  First, it me ans that you should never hide 
t h i n g s  i n  y o u r  H T M L  c o d e  t h a t  y o u  w o u l d n ’ t  w a n t  o t h e r s  t o  s e e .   F o r  e x a m p l e ,  t h e r e ’ s  a  
method for putting comments into HTML code  which don’t show up on the finished web 
page but which will show up if someone views your source code. 
  Second, the public nature of HTML means th a t ,  i f  y o u  w a n t  t o  k n o w  h o w  s o m e o n e  h a s  
achieved a particular effect on their web page, you can just view their code and find out.  There’s nothing wrong with doing that.  Profession al web people do it all the time.   However, 
if you’re tempted to copy and paste entire chunks of someone else’s hard work into the code 
view screen on Amaya, don’t be.  It’s technica lly possible, of course, but morally and legally 
wrong.  
Validating your HTML 
 
Designing a web page isn’t particularly easy, espe cially if you want to ensure that your HTML 
code is correct.  Thankfully, there are various web sites available on the internet which will 
automatically check one or more pages on your site and report any errors.  These sites exist 
because of the above-mentioned lack of privacy when it comes to HTML.  If your page is on the internet, anyone, or any automated system, can look at its HTML code. 
 
The best-known HTML validator, as such services are called, is run by the World Wide Web 
Consortium (WWWC, or W3C for short).  To use it, just go to http://validator.w3.org  
and enter the address of your page.  If you haven’t yet uploaded the page to a server, there’s 
an option that lets you upload the HTML file to the validator, or you can even copy and paste 
a block of HTML code straight from Amaya into the validator.

Either way, the end result of the validation is (hopefully) a congratulatory screen such as 
this: 
  
 
 
If your code fails validation, the validator will normally tell yo u why, so you can go back and 
fix any problems. 
 
It’s always a good idea to ensure that all your pages validate correctly.  If they don’t, there’s 
no guarantee that every visitor’s web browser will  be able to display your pages properly.  In 
some cases the layout might look slightly wron g, while in others the page might not display 
at all.  Some browsers are much more forgivin g of minor errors such as unclosed tags, or 
tables where a new row is started before the previous one ends.  Some, though, will complain 
bitterly. 
A Bit More about Accessibility 
 Like many aspects of web site design, accessibi lity (making it possible for people with sight 
and mobility problems to use your site) is one of those things that’s remarkably easy to build 
in from the start but very time-consuming to retrofit as an afterthought. Therefore, it makes 
sense to consider it as early as possible in the overall design process.    
Some of the things that you should do to en sure that your site is accessible include: 
 
• Provide alternative ALT text for every picture or image that you use. 
 
• Don’t create information which can’t be un derstood by those wh o can’t see colours 
properly.  Eg, “Click the red box rather th an the green one in order to browse our 
brochure” will be of little use to someone who’s colour-blind.

• Ensure that there is sufficient contrast between text and background colours.  
 
• Avoid scrolling text and other dynamic effects.  They are hard to read. 
 
• Avoid any technique which may produc e flickering effects on-screen.  
 
• Use the clearest and simplest language for site content. 
 
• Keep paragraphs short, and include some white space between them.  
 
• Do not use frames.   Screen  readers don’t like them. 
 
• Dark text on a light background works bett er that light text on a dark background. 
 
• Use a line spacing of around 1.5 to ensure that the text on a page doesn’t look too 
“heavy”. 
 
Now that you know the basics of HTML, and spec ifically the way that formatting tags work 
for things such as paragraphs, headings, bold text and so on,  we can move on to learn about CSS.

Cascading Style Sheets 
 
One of the key techniques used in modern web page design techniques is something called 
the separation of presentation and content.  In the early days of the web, there was no way to 
do this, which meant that HTML pages were bloa ted, repetitive and difficult to understand.  
For example, if you wanted the main body text of the site to use the Verdana typeface, in a 
s i z e  o f  1 2  p t ,  e v e r y  s i n g l e  p a r a g r a p h  o f  t e x t  w o u l d  n e e d  t o  s t a r t  w i t h  a  <font 
face=verdana size=12pt> tag.  That could amount to hundreds or thousands of such 
tags across the entire site.  If you subsequently wanted to redesign the site, changing all those 
tags was a lot of work. 
 
A few years ago, along came a ne w revision of the HTML langua ge (and a new generation of 
web browsers that were capable of displaying pages created with it).  Top of the list of new 
features was something called CSS, or Casc ading Style Sheets, or HTML Style Sheets. 
 
A style sheet is a separate file that complements one, some, or all of the HTML pages on your 
site.  It contains all the information about ho w the text, pictures and layout of your pages 
actually looks.  So, to update the above exam ple, there might be a section in the CSS file 
which states that all instances of the <p> tag should use the Verdana typeface in a 12pt size.  
Now, all the pages of your site merely need to surround the paragraphs with nothing more 
than a <p> tag and they’ll all magically appear in  the correct typeface and size.  The best bit, 
is that you can tweak the appearance of every paragraph in your entire site just by changing 
one entry in a single CSS file, rather th an having to change any <font> tags. 
 
CSS has other benefits too.  When you specify wh ich CSS file is to be used to format your 
page, you can actually specify di fferent CSS files for different situations.  For example, one 
set of styles for when the page is viewed on screen and a different set for when the user prints the page on their printer. And yet another set for when someone views the page on a 
smartphone or a PDA or a projector. 
 
I mentioned accessibility, and making your site disability-friendly, on page 49.  CSS can help 
here too.   You can set up a separate style sh eet for people who have basic sight problems or 
dyslexia, ie large text, no graphics, and a more  readable background colour.  You can then 
easily add an option to your site that uses th is style sheet rather than the normal one, for 
those visitors who prefer it.   And all, of course , without having to maintain separate copies of 
the page content, because this is now separa te from the presentation side of things. 
 
The ability to separate presentation and content has other benefits too.  Creating good web 
sites requires skills in both writing and desi gn.  CSS means that one person can concentrate 
on writing the content for the site, while some one else can work their magic on the style 
sheets.

CSS is so much part of web design nowadays, th at it’s rare for anyone to create a new site 
from scratch which uses the old <font> tags.  Th at’s not to say that there aren’t millions of 
old-fashioned pages still around, but CSS is definitely a better way of doing things, so that’s 
the method that we’ll cover in this book. 
About DOCTYPEs 
 
Before we start with CSS, a word about docu ment types.  You'll have noticed, above the 
<head>  section in the HTML code shown on page 53, , a line that starts with the word 
DOCTYPE.  In full, the line is:  
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xHTML1/DTD/xHTML1-transitional.dtd"> 
 
This is known as DTD, or Document Type Definition. 
 HTML is continually evolving.  As mentioned above, for example, the advent of CSS now 
means that you are advised not to use <font> ta gs.  The DOCTYPE is a way for you to tell the 
visitor's web browser which version of HTML yo u'll be using.  With this information, the 
browser can ensure that your page displays correctly. 
 
The two main document types that you'll see used most are XHTML 1.0 Strict and XHTML 1.0 Transitional.  Transitional is the version th at allows both new-style CSS as well as old-
fashioned <font> tags.  "Strict" mode doesn' t allow <font> tags. If you specify a Strict 
document type, and then proceed to use <font> tags, you are technically producing invalid HTML which the browser might well reject. 
 
The simplest option is therefore always to use a Transitional doctype, but to adhere to the 
latest standards and techniques. 
Getting Started with CSS 
 If Amaya isn’t already open on your computer, open it now.  Then load your index.html 
home page.  The quickest way to do this is to use the right-hand menu pane, which is not 
something we’ve covered before. 
 
The right-hand side of your Amaya screen prob ably looks, right now, something like this:

There are various menu op tions that can be opened and closed on this panel, each of which is 
preceded by a  h character, such as Elements, Style, List  of style sheets, Files, Attributes, and 
so on.  When a menu set is visible, the prefix shows as j.   When it’s hidden, the character 
shows as h instead.  You can show or hide these sect ions by clicking on the arrow characters. 
 
Perhaps the most useful of these sections is File s, which brings up a simple file manager that 
makes it quick and easy to open any of your exis ting web pages.  The Apply Class box is also 
useful, for reasons that we’ll come to shortly. 
 
So, click on the arrow characters to close all of the sections, then open the Files section and 
the Apply Class section.  Your screen should now look thus:

Note, by the way, that the Style section is nothing to do with C SS. It’s a built-in feature of 
Amaya that uses a non-standard way of changing the look of web pages, so we won’t be using 
it.  
Now it’s time to open your index.html page.  Use your newly-found file manager to browse to 
your Web Work folder, and double-click on index.html.  Or, if you prefer, go to the File menu 
on the top line and then use the Open Document option.  Either way, you’ll end up with your 
index.html page open and ready for editing. 
 We now need to create the style sheet file for ou r site.  From the File menu on the top of the 
screen, choose New, then New Style Sheet. Use the folder button to browse to your Web W o r k  f o l d e r  i f  i t ’ s  n o t  a l r e a d y  s h o w n .   A m a y a  w a n t s  t o  n a m e  t h e  f i l e  N e w . c s s  b u t  t h i s  i s  unwise.  It is conventional to name the main style sheet file style.css and not to include any 
capital letters in the name.  So change New.cs s to style.css in the New CSS Style Sheet box. 
 
In the same box, select the In New Tab  radio button for where to open the file, then click 
Create.

You will see that there are now 2 (or maybe 3) tabs open in Amaya.  One is your index page, 
and the other is your css file.  You can cl ick on the tabs to switch between files. 
 
In the previous chapter, we learned about HTML tags.  Now, we can start to create a style 
sheet that applies pa rticular formatting to particular tags. 
 
Into your blank css file, type the following: 
 
p  { 
font-family: Verdana; 
color: red 
} 
 
Your screen will look like this: 
 
 
 We’ve now created the first entry for our site’s st yle sheet.  This specif ies that all <p> tags 
should use the Verdana font and should be coloured red.   
 
The format of a CSS file is fairly easy to understand, once you know the basics.  On the first line of each entry goes the name of the HTML tag that you want to specify a style for, 
followed by a curly bracket.  On subsequent line s, specify the various aspects of that style,

such as font-family and color.  I’ll explain later how to find out what other style aspects are 
available.   
 Each style aspect ends with a semi-colon.  Finally comes a closing curly bracket. 
 
Note that the semicolon on the final style characteristic is optional, as you can see from the 
way that it’s not been included in the examples on the illustration below.  However, it’s 
generally good practice to get into the habit of always including the semicolon at the end of 
every line.  Otherwise, if you a dd new style options below what is  currently the last line in a 
style definition, and you forget to add the semico lon to what is no longer the last line, your 
style sheet file won’t work properly because the web browser won’t always know where one line ends and the next one begins.  
While we’re here, let’s add another style definition  to our CSS file, this time for the <ul> tag 
which defines a bulleted list (ul stands for Unordered List, in contrast  t o  a  n u m b e r e d  l i s t  
which uses the <ol> tag for an ordered list).  
So, add a new section to the CSS screen as follows:  
ul { 
color: green; } 
 
Your CSS file should now look like this:

 Flip back to your index.html page by clicking on its tab.  Has anything changed?  Are your 
paragraphs now in Verdana and coloured red?   Sadly not, for one very good reason.  
Although you’ve created a style sheet, we ha ven’t yet added the nece ssary command to our 
index page to specify where it should get its style information from.   So let’s change that. 
 
First we need to save the style sheet that we were working on.  So flip to the style sheet tab 
and, from the File menu, choose Save.  Now flip back to the index.html page tab. 
 
From the Format menu, choose Style Sheets and then the Link option.   In the box, just type style.css and press the Confirm button.  There’s no need to specify the full path, because both 
your index.html page and your style.css file are in the same folder. 
 And now, as if by magic, your index page has changed.  Your paragraphs of text are now, as 
requested, using the Verd ana font and are red. 
 
We also specified a style for our unordered lists, so let’s see if that works too.  First, type a 
few short paragraphs into your index page like this:

As expected, they will be red and Verdana because that’s what the style sheet says that 
paragraphs should be.  But that’s about to change. 
 Select your entries, using the keyboard or mous e.  Then, from the Insert menu, choose List, 
then Unordered List.  Here’s what the screen should look like now:

Your list uses <ul> tags, and your style sheet sa ys that <ul> tags should be green.  So they 
are. 
 
The list items aren’t using the Verdana font, thou gh, because your ul tag style didn’t say that 
they should.  But we can fix that quickly and easily.  Flip back to your css file by clicking on 
its tab.  Add a new line to the ul tag style to specify font-family: Verdana.  Save the css file 
and then flip back to the index page, and you should find that the font used by your list has 
now changed. 
 
The ability to change one, or indeed hundreds, of  pages by making a single change to a single 
style sheet file is what makes CSS so useful.  If all of the pages in your site are linked to the 
same style sheet, changing the CSS file  changes all of the pages instantly. 
A Word About Fonts 
 You probably have one or two hu ndred fonts installed on your computer.  Most people do.  
Every time you install a new program, it freque ntly comes with a selection of new fonts that 
are installed.  If you look at the list of avai lable fonts in Microsoft Word, or whatever word 
processor you happen to use, the list will be en ormous.  However, that doesn’t mean that you 
can use all of them on your Web pages.

When you specify a font in your CSS file, the actual data (all those lines and curves) that 
m a k e  u p  t h e  f o n t  d o n ’ t  g e t  i n c l u d e d  i n  t h e  p a g e .   A l l  t h a t  m a k e s  i t  i n t o  t h e  H T M L  i s  a n  
instruction to the visitor’s web browser to disp lay your chosen text in your chosen font.  
Which only works if that font happens to be installed on the visitor’s computer.  If it’s not, 
the browser will make a stab at choosing a font that looks vaguely similar, but the end results 
are rarely identical. 
 
Because of this, it’s always safest to ensure that  you only specify fonts in your CSS files which 
are pretty much guaranteed to be installed as standard on most visitors’ computers.  
Although there aren’t many such fonts, they do provide a fairly wide cross-section of styles.  
The fonts in question are as follows, in their ac tual style so you can see what they look like: 
 
Arial 
Verdana 
Trebuchet MS 
Courier New 
Georgia 
Times New Roman 
 
Note that these names are case-sensitive, so spec ifying verdana in a style definition isn’t the 
same as Verdana, and probably won’t work unless the visitor’s web browser is feeling 
particularly forgiving at the time.  Which most modern browsers never do. 
 
These 6 fonts can be classified loosely into three categories.  Arial , Verdana  and Trebuchet 
MS are what’s known as sans-serif fonts.  Serifs are the embellishments on the ends of 
characters, and sans-serif fonts don’t have th em.  Compare this with serif fonts such as 
Georgia (which is used throughout this book) and Times New Roman .   
 
For body text, ie the main bulk of the text on your pages, sans-serif fonts tend to work best.  For headlines and picture captions, serif fonts look good. 
 
Courier New  is an example of a fixed-width font.  In this font, each character is the same 
width.  So the word 
RAILWAY  is the same width as the word ILLICIT , as they both 
contain 7 characters.  Like this: 
 
RAILWAY 
ILLICIT 
 
In fonts that aren’t fixed-width, each letter is a different width.  Like this:

RAILWAY 
ILLICIT 
 
Such fonts are often known as proportionally-s paced fonts, as each character’s width on 
paper is proportional to its actual width. 
 Using a fixed-width, non-proporti onal font is useful in lists of numbers if you want all the 
columns to line up correctly. For just about al l other purposes, proportional fonts tend to be 
more readable and look more pr ofessional.  Unless you specifically want to create a web page 
that looks like it was produced on a typewriter. 
Classes 
 
So far, in our discussion of CSS, we’ve talked about defining styles based on HTML tags.  By 
creating a style definition for the <p> tag we can specify how all of the body paragraphs on 
our pages look.  Equally, by creating a style call ed ul, we can style all of our unordered lists.  
If you were to add a style for th e h1 tag, you could change the l ook of all the level-1 headings 
on your pages. 
 As you might expect, there’s a lot more to CSS than letting you choose a font and a colour to 
be associated with HTML tags.  Actually, CSS is  hugely complicated, an d is the bane of most 
professional web developers’ live s.  A typical reference book on  CSS runs to over 600 pages, 
but thankfully we’re not going to go into that mu ch detail in this book.  There is, though, one 
more highly useful feature of CSS that you’ll  want to know about, and that’s classes. 
 A class is a style that you can use anywhere on a web page, rather than for a particular HTML 
tag.  Rather than being named after a tag, yo u can name your classes as you see fit.  For 
example, if you often find your self mentioning the name of yo ur favourite cheese on your 
web pages, you could create a class called fave-cheese.  Then, wherever the name of that cheese appears, you assign it to that class.  The text can be an entire paragraph, a few lines, 
or even just one word.  Here’s how to create a CSS class and refer to it within a web page. 
 
Make sure that Amaya is open, and that you ha ve both your index.html and style.css files 
open in separate tabs.  Now, in your st yle sheet file, add a new style as follows: 
 
.fave-cheese { 
color: yellow; font-family: Arial; 
font-size: 18px; 
}

There are 2 differences between this style and the others that we have created.  First, we 
chose our own name for the style, rather than using the name of an HTML tag.  Second, the style name starts with a dot.  The dot is what tells the browser th at this is a class rather than 
an HTML tag style.  Save your css file (File, Save), then flip back to the index page.  Notice the Apply Class area 
on the right hand side of the sc reen, which now lists your class. 
 
Type some text onto the page, hi ghlight it, then double-click yo ur class name in the list.,  
Your chosen text is now formatted according to your class.  Highlight some more text and 
apply the class to it too.  
Between them, tag styles and classes allow you to format your web pages just about any way 
you wish.  If you want to style al l instances of a particular tag, ie all of your h1 headings or all 
of your paragraphs, use tag styles.   Where yo u want to just style a few words or sentences 
here and there, use a class. 
Making Styles Work For You 
 
T h e  m a i n  b e n e f i t  o f  u s i n g  s t y l e s  i n  H T M L  p a g e s  i s  t h a t  t h e y  m a k e  i t  e a s y  t o  m a k e  w i d e -
reaching changes to a web site with a single click.   Just change a single entry in your css file 
and the entire site changes.  However, if you are to gain the maximum benefit from using css 
there are two things you need to know about. 
 
First, keep the number of styles  (tag and class) to a minimum. If you find yourself creating 6 
different versions of the fave-cheese class in or der to fit the particular idiosyncrasies of your 
site’s layout (eg one version for headings, one fo r picture captions etc), you lose much of the 
benefit of CSS because there are now 6 different things that you need to change if you want to alter the way that the names of your cheeses are displayed.   
 
Second, choose your class names with care.  Pick  names based on what th e class is used for, 
not what it looks like.  Consider what woul d happen if I’d named my cheese class "arial-
yellow" rather than "fave-cheese".  If I ever redesign my site and decide that I want the 
cheese names in purple rather than yellow, I’ll end up with a class called arial-yellow which actually displays in purple.  This will make it much less obvious to me, or anyone else in the 
future, to remember what each class is used for.

To make the most of  HTML tag styles, you obviously need to know what tag names are 
a v a i l a b l e  t o  y o u .  Y o u  c a n  f i n d  a  c o m p l e t e  l i s t  o n  t h e  i n t e r n e t  ( j u s t  t y p e  H T M L  T a g s  i n t o  
Google), but here are a few to get you started:  
<h1> to <h6>  Heading level 1 to 6 
<table>  Used at the start of a table. <tr>   Starts each row of a table. 
<td>   Stands for Table Data.  Us ed for each cell of the table. 
<b>   Bold text. 
<i>   Italic text. 
<body>  The entire body of the web page. 
<ul>   Unordered list, using bullets at the start of each item. <ol>   Ordered (ie, numbered) list 
<li>   A list item (used within ordered and unordered lists). 
<a>   Anchor.  Used to create hyperlinks. 
A Better CSS Editor 
 
Style sheets are an incredibly powerful featur e of modern web design, and there’s absolutely 
no reason why you should use any other method  to format your pages.  Unfortunately, 
A m a y a  d o e s n ’ t  m a k e  i t  p a r t i c u l a r l y  e a s y  t o  c r e a t e  a n d  m a i n t a i n  C S S  f i l e s .   S o  f a r ,  y o u ’ v e  
created styles manually, line by line.  This is  slow, prone to errors, and only works if you 
happen to know the language of css (f ont-family, color, and so on).   
 
N o w  t h a t  y o u  u n d e r s t a n d  t h e  b a s i c s  o f  w h a t  a css file is, and the sort of commands it 
contains, we need to find a better program for editing css files.  Preferably one that’s free.  
There are quite a few such programs available, downloadable from the internet.  The best 
one, in my opinion, is Topstyle Lite.  It’s a cut-down version of a commercial product called 
Topstyle Pro, which offers even more features .  But for anyone who needs a basic program to 
easily create and edit css files, Topstyle Lite is perfect.  
Your next task, therefore, is to download an d install Topstyle Lite.  Close Amaya for the 
moment, but don’t uninstall it.  We’ll contin ue to use Amaya for editing HTML pages. 
 
To download Topstyle Lite, go to www.newsgator.com  and follow the links to Topstyle and 
then to Topstyle Lite.  Or type "topstyle lite "  into Goog l e.   Once  you  ha ve  downl oa ded the 
installer file, double-click it to start the instal lation.  The version of Topstyle Lite that we’re 
using in this book is 3.5.

One of the great things about the web is that HT ML and css files are just standard text files, 
rather than using proprietary or  complex formats such as Word or Excel.  This means that 
you can switch editors easily.  If you don’t li k e  A m a y a ,  y o u  c a n  l o a d  y o u r  H T M L  f i l e  i n t o  
another application.  Equally, the css file th at we created earlier with Amaya can now be 
loaded into Topstyle Lite.  Let’s start by changing the colour of  our favourite cheese text, from yellow to blue.  Not just 
any blue, but a nice bright pale blue.  In Am aya, you’d have to know the name (or code 
number) for the particular colour, but Topstyle Lite makes things much easier. 
 
Click somewhere within any of the 3 lines that make up the definition of the .fave-cheese 
class, and you’ll see the full details of the styl e shown on the right hand side of the screen.  
Click the yellow block and an arrow linking to a drop-down list of colours will appear.  Click 
that arrow.  Choose a colour from the list of options, or select the top option from the list which says Choose Colour.  This then brings up a colour picker from which you can select the 
p a r t i c u l a r  s h a d e  o f  b l u e  t h a t  y o u  w a n t .   W h e n  y o u ’ r e  f i n i s h e d ,  c l i c k  O K .   S e e  h o w  t h e  
definition of the class has been edited. 
 Let’s use TopStyle Lite to create a completely ne w style.  We’ll create a tag style for a second-
level heading, ie the <h2> tag.

Move your cursor down to the bottom of th e screen, below the existing pair of style 
definitions.  Then, from the Edit menu, click on New Selector.  A selector is the official name 
for a style's title (whether it's a tag or a class).  In this case it’s a tag so, in the HTML Element 
box, scroll down to h2, select it, and click OK. 
 
TopStyle Lite will create the first and last  lines of the style de finition, like this: 
 
h2 { 
 } 
 
Now you can use the panel on the right hand side  to select the style and design of your h2 
tags.   Here’s an example: 
 
 
 
As you can see, I’ve chosen a text colour of dark  orange, and a top border of a grey line that’s 
1 pixel thick.  Using TopStyle Lite to create a new class, rather than a tag style, is just as easy.  Again, 
choose New Selector from the Edit menu to br ing up the New Selector box that looks like 
this:

From the set of radio buttons that offer a choice  of Class or ID, choose Class. Then, in the box 
below, type the name of your class, and then choose the options as you wish.  TopStyle Lite 
will automatically add the dot at the fr ont of the class name if you forget. 
 
When you’ve finished experimenting with TopSty le Lite, save your css file by choosing Save 
from the File menu, then quit the program.  
 
Before we leave the subject of CSS and TopStyle Lite for the time being, let’s just check that 
our new <h2> tag style works correctly.   
 
Open Amaya, then open your index.html page.  Type a few words, and highlight them.  Then, 
from the Insert menu, choose Heading and then H2.  This will mark those words as a level-2 
heading by surrounding them with an <h2> tag at the start and a </h2> tag at the end.  You 
should find that your words now display correct ly, using the h2 style that you created with 
TopStyle Lite. 
ID-based Styles 
 
Before we leave this brief introduction to C SS, there’s one more thing you need to know 
about, before you can move on to the next chapter.  So far we’v e covered two different 
selector types, namely tags and classes.  There’s actually a third type, called an ID.  Here’s 
how it works. 
 HTML allows you to assign a unique name, or id , to any tag on a page.  The only stipulation 
is that a name must be unique on that page.  For example, consider this level-2 heading: 
 
<h2>Further Information About Cheddar Cheese</h2>

We can give this heading a unique id by changing the opening h2 tag thus: 
 
<h2 id="further-cheese">Further Info rmation About Cheddar Cheese</h2> 
 Unless you say otherwise, this heading will appear  as any h2 heading would, according to the 
h2 entry in your style sheet.  But because this  particular heading has its own id, we can do 
something rather clever in  the css file, like this: 
 
#further-cheese { 
 color: navy; 
} 
 
Notice the # symbol at the start of the style name.  This signifies an ID-based style.  It simply  
means that the style is only applied to the HTML tag which has the id of further-cheese.  It 
doesn't matter whether that tag is an h2 heading, a paragraph, a list item, or indeed anything 
else. The only rule is that you mustn’t assign the same id to more than one HTML tag on the 
same page.  If you need to apply the style in  more than one place, use a class instead. 
Extreme CSS 
 
When used relatively simply, CSS is a powerful tool that will help you create web pages that 
are easier to understand and easier to main tain, when compared to the old way of doing 
things with <font> tags.  But if you thought th at this chapter has taught you everything there 
is to know about CSS, you’re sadly mistaken.  By using the advanced features of CSS you can 
gain even greater control over the look of your pages.  For example, here’s the home page of one of the best exponents of CSS- based design, namely the folks at 
www.csszengarden.com :

By clicking on the menu entries on the right hand side of the page, you can choose other CSS 
style sheets to apply to the page.  For example, here’s the Orchid Beauty style:

The point to remember here is that the HTML file which contains the page content (ie, the text such as "Littering a dark and dreary road…") is the same each time.  It hasn’t changed.  
All that changes is the CSS file that it’s linked  to, which controls the position and appearance 
of the text, and the positions and names of the image files.

Page Layouts and Div Tags 
 
So far, our look at CSS has concentrated on  visual appearances.  We’ve covered how to 
specify fonts, sizes, and colours.  But CSS is mu ch more than that.  Most importantly, it also 
covers the layout and arrangement of pages.  For example, look at this page.  
 
 Notice that the page is divided into two column s.  Actually, the top section of the page, which 
contains the Spiderweb title and the grey bar, uses the full width of the page.  The remainder 
of the page is split into two vertical columns.   The left-hand column holds some links, while 
the main content of the page is on the right hand side. 
 
This layout is typical of many web sites.  They use a two- or three-column layout in order to 
fit all the required content on the page in a logical place.  Having the page’s collection of links 
and menus (known as the navigation, or nav for short) in a separate column like this also 
means that the main content is narrower than the full width of the screen.  This makes it 
easier for people to read the page on screen. 
 
So, how do we use CSS to create a page layout like this?  The key is the <div> tag.  A div, in 
this context, stands for a divider or a division.  It  lets you separate entire blocks of your page,

including other HTML tags, into discrete items whose layout can then be controlled by the 
css file. 
 A div is not like any of the HTML tags we’ve encountered so far.  It’s not the sort of thing that 
you’d assign a font or colour to.  Instead, yo u use css to specify its position on the page, 
relative to the top left hand corner or to other divs. You can also specify its background 
colour, border, margin and so on. 
 
By carefully nesting your divs, ie opening a ne w one before closing the current one, you can 
create the hierarchy that leads to the columnar effect shown above. 
 So in the above example, the page comprises 4 divs. First is the overall outer div which holds the entire page.  Within this ar e 3 more divs, to create the top panel, the left hand column 
and the right hand column.  As a simpler example, let’s use divs and css to lay out a page.  Here’s the effect we want to 
end up with:  
 
 
Here we have a very common web page format.  A header line at the top, a left and a right 
hand column, and a footer area at the bottom.  
Here’s what the body section of the HTML file l ooks like, for this page.  I’ve added some line 
numbers to assist in the explanation which follows – these are not part of the HTML and you 
should remove them if you want to paste this into Amaya to experiment further.

You may be surprised at just how short and un-compl icated it is. Let’s take a look at this code 
in a little more detail, because understanding th e basics of div-based page layout is vital if 
you want to know more about how web sites work. 
 
On line 2 we create a div and we name it contai ner.  This is the overall div that contains the 
rest of the page.  It doesn’t matter what names you choose for your divs, but many web 
people choose to call the main div the container.  On line 3 we create another div called top.  This is effectively inside the container because we 
haven’t yet closed the container div.  The top div gets closed on line 5, and its contents (just 
an h1 heading) appear on line 4.  
Between lines 6 and 10 we create another div called leftnav, the contents of which is just a 
single paragraph.  Lines 11 to 18 hold the content div, which is the right-hand column in the illustration above. Lines 19 to  21 create our footer div.  
 Finally, on line 22, we close the container div.

With the page created, we can now create the css file for it.  Here’s what it looks like. You’ll 
see that I’ve used a slightly different formatting  layout, with the { symbols on a separate line.  
It’s quite OK to do th is if you prefer it. 
 
#container

width: 90%; 
margin: 10px auto; background-color: #fff;

} 
 
#footer { 
clear: both; 
margin: 0; padding: .5em; 
color: #333; 
background-color: #ddd; border-top: 1px solid gray; 
} 
 #leftnav p { margin: 0 0 1em 0; } 
#content h2 { margin: 0 0 .5em 0; } 
 
The first section of this css file is #container .  This, if you remember, means that we’re about 
to specify the styles for the HTML tag whose id is container.  Which just happens to be our 
main div.  Of primary interest is  the fact that we’re setting its width to 90%.  This means that 
the overall width of our page will be 90% of the screen width, on whatever screen the visitor 
happens to be using to view our site.  If you look at the picture of the page, the remaining 
10% is taken up by the vertical areas of white sp ace to the left and right of the main text area. 
 
The second section, #top, is used to specify a few more things about the top div.  Below this 
is a section entitled #top h1.   This is so mething we’ve not encountered before, and is yet 
another useful feature of css. In this case, it means that the styles which follow are only to be 
applied to  level-one headin gs within the #top div. 
 
The final 2 sections, #leftnav p and #content h2, use the same technique.  They specify what 
the standard paragraph text will look like in  the leftnav column, and how the h2 heading in 
the content pane will appear. 
 
Although this may all seem very complicated at first, it’s fairly easy to get used to with some 
practice.  If you want to use this example as a starting point for your own pages, just type or 
paste the HTML code and the css file into Amaya, and then tweak the content and styles as 
you wish.  By experimenting with TopStyle Lite  to change the styles, you can make the page 
look just how you want it to.

addition, you'll also need to add HTML and BODY tags to the html file, as well as linking the 
style sheet to it.

You would be well advised to start with a ready-made design from a site such as

online resources available.  A Google search fo r terms such as "css tutorial" or "learning css" 
will get you started. 
 
One of the most important concepts in css-ba sed page layout is something called the box 
model.  It explains how padding, spacing, just ification (left, right, centred etc) and margins 
interact to affect the final position of an item on a page.

Pictures On Pages 
 
To put a picture on one of your Web pages, here’s what you need to do:  
1. Obtain the picture as an image file (typically .JPG or .TIF) from your scanner, camera or any other suitable source. 
2. Copy the image file into your web folder al ong with the HTML files that make up your 
site 
3. Add an <img> tag to the HTML page at the point where you want the picture to appear. 
 Let’s try doing this now. 
 
First we need to find a picture to use.  If you have something to hand, copy it to your Web 
Work folder.  If you don’t have any images, visi t your favourite web site, right-click one of the 
pictures on the page and choose "Save Picture As", and save it in your Web Work folder. 
 
You might at this point be somewhat surprised to  discover that stealing pictures from other 
people’s web sites is as easy as right-clicking.  Sadly, this is generally the case.  Never assume 
that pictures on your web site are safe from othe rs who want to use them.  If this is a problem 
for you, eg if you’re a professional photographer  or artist and you want to show off your work 
online without others helping themselves to it , the best deterrent is to upload only small 
thumbnail pictures onto your public site.  An yone who wants to see full-size pictures can 
then be asked to pay before bein g allowed into a separate, subscribers-only area of the site.  
Another option is to use a graphics program to add a watermark or logo to your pictures, but 
this detracts from their overall look.  With your picture safely stored in your Web Work folder,  open Amaya and load one of your 
HTML pages.  From the Insert menu, choose Image.  Then browse to your Web Work folder 
and select the picture you placed there earlier.    
In the space provided, type some "alternate text ".   This is the text that a visitor’s web 
browser will display if the visito r hovers their mouse over the picture.  It’s also the text that 
will be read out aloud to anyone who visits yo ur site with the aid of some screen reader 
software.  Therefore it’s a good idea to always include some alternate text (or alt text, as it’s 
known) for every picture you use on your site.  In fact, Amaya won’t let you leave this box 
blank so you have no choice in the matter. 
 
Your chosen picture will now appear on your we b page.  Here’s how it looks on my computer.  
Note that I’ve used the Show Source option to show both th e standard page and the HTML 
source code:

Notice the <img> tag in the lower window, which specifies the name of the image file, the alt 
text for it, and the width and height of the picture.  If you want to see your finished page online, upload both the HTML page and the image file 
to the hosting space on your server.  Don’t forg et to always upload all of the image files that 
your site uses.  If you don’t, and a visitor’ s web browser encounters a page where the <img> 
tag references a picture file which doesn’t exist on the server, the picture on the page will typically be replaced by an empty box with a red cr oss in it.  If you’ve ever seen a page on the 
web which looks like this, now you know why.  The person who created the page forgot to 
upload the image file, or they renamed the image file on the server without updating the <img> tags on the page to match. 
About Image Sizes 
 
The dimensions of a picture file on a comput er are generally measured in pixels, and the 
o v e r a l l  s i z e  o f  t h e  f i l e  i s ,  l i k e  a n y  o t h e r  f i l e ,  m e a s u r e d  i n  K B  a n d  M B  ( k i l o b y t e s  a n d  megabytes).   
 The typical person who visits your web site will have a screen size of around 1024 pixels wide 
by 768 pixels deep.  So if you want a picture which fits on the screen alongside some text and

navigation, you’ll probably want to ensure that  the image is roughly 300 pixels wide and 200 
deep.  Equally, if you want the pi cture to take up almost all of the screen, a size of 1000 by 
700 might suffice. 
 
However, the typical image from a modern digital camera is often more like 3000 by 2000 
pixels.  Take something from your scanner in high-resolution scanning  mode, and it could 
even be 3 or 4 times that figure.   The picture will thus be far too big to fit on the screen.  The 
web site visitor will have to scroll with in their browser to see the full image. 
 
Some web developers get around this by changi ng the width and height settings in the <img> 
tag.  This forces the browser to resize the image to the required size.  However, it doesn’t 
change the overall size of the image file on the server, in terms of its KB and MB.  A picture from your camera that’s 3000 pixels wide, in a file that’s 4 MB, will still occupy 4 MB of 
server space if you alter the <img> tag to disp lay the picture at 200 pixels wide.  It will 
therefore still download very slowly  onto your visitors’ computers.  
 
So, here’s a vital rule about pictures on web sites that you should always follow.  If the 
picture you want to use on your page isn’t the right size, use an image editing program to resize it BEFORE  placing it on your web page.  Never  resize a picture by changing the width 
and height settings in the img tag.  If you don't have a program that can resize pictures, upload the image to somewhere like 
www.piknik.com  and use their online tools.   
Pictures As Links 
 On page 48 we learned about hyperlinks, and how to turn a snippet of text into a clickable

to which the visitor will be take n when they click the picture. 
 
Note that some browsers add a border around any picture which is used as a link, and this 
may mean that the picture doesn’t look quite as you want it to.  To get around this, set the 
picture's border width to zero somewhere within  the <img> tag for the picture.  For example: 
 
<img src="picture.jpg" alt="This is a picture" border="0"> 
Finding Images to Use on Your Site 
 
Stealing images from web sites to use on your own is both morally and legally wrong.  
There’s no harm in borrowing such a picture as a training exercise, which is what we’re doing 
here, but it’s certainly not advisable to do it on a real web site.  If you need an image to 
illustrate your site but you don’t have your camera to hand, or you don’t have a suitable 
image, help is thankfully at hand.  There’s a variety of web sites which offer royalty-free 
pictures that you can use on your sites without payment.  My favourite is at www.sxc.hu , 
which is registered in Hungary but is presented in English.

A Browser Icon for your Site 
 
Have you ever noticed how some web sites have their own special icon that appears in your 
web browser’s list of favourites , and on the browser’s address bar? It also appears on the 
desktop if you create a shortcut to the site.  An icon like this can help to make your site stand 
out on your visitors’ computers, and also adds an extra degree of professionalism to your 
design. 
 
For example, if I add the BBC News web site to my list of favourites, notice the small black 
BBC icon in the address bar and in my Favorites menu: 
 
 
 
This sort of icon is known as a "favicon", beca use its most common purposes is to appear on 
your visitors’ lists of favourite sites.    If you wa nt one  for your site it’s not hard to do.  What 
you need is a graphics program which has the ab ility to create and save an image in favicon 
format. 
 
While there are many such programs around, some of which are downloadable for free, it doesn’t really make sense to install a progra m on your computer that you won’t use very 
often.  There are quite a few online favicon editors that you access via your web browser, and these work just as well.  A Google search for "favicon editor" or "online favicon editor" will bring up lots of them, so just  pick one that works for you. 
 As an example I'll use the one at:  
http://www.mobilefish.com/services/favicon/favicon.php

Short Cuts to Great Web Pages 
 
Now that you know the basics of HTML and CSS, you’re probably itching to create some real pages. However, you’re probably also feeling rather daunted, having realised that creating a 
web page which looks good isn’t going to  be as easy as you might have hoped. 
 
Thankfully, help is at hand.  There are lots  of ready-made page designs that you can 
download for free from the internet, and then customise as you wish.  It’s much easier to start with someone else’s design and then ad apt it, rather than creating something from 
scratch.  However, even if you’re starting with someone else’s work, you will find it difficult 
to customise the page unless you know the ba sics of HTML and CSS first.  Hence the 
previous chapters. 
 
Two of the best-known sites that offer fr ee, ready-made, CSS-ba sed templates are: 
 
Open Source Web Designs www.oswd.org  
Open Designs   www.opendesigns.org  
 
Both sites are very similar in nature.  You brow se the list of availa ble designs, and then 
download any that you want to use.  Each design normally consists of a single index.html file containing the sample design, an accompanying st yle.css file, and a collection of pictures that 
the site uses.  Once you have download all of th is, you turn it into a us able site by doing the 
following:  
1. Tweak the CSS in order to fine-tune the look and feel 
2. Tweak the index.html file too, if required 
3. Copy the index.html file as many times as necessary, in order to create each of the 
pages for your site 
4. Tweak or replace some or all of the image files, if required, to make the site more relevant to your audience. 
5. Upload the finished set of files to your hosting space. 
 Here’s an extract from OSWD, so you can se e the sort of material that’s available:

Both sites are similar in what they offer, and each contains around 2000 separate designs.  
Remember, though, that what you get is not a finished web site.  It ’s just a single page, nicely 
designed, that you can use as a building block.  
Using an Open Source Design 
 
As an example of how to download and use a free ly available web design, let’s take a look at 
one of them in detail.  In this  case, the design comes from opendesigns.org and is called Hot 
Gray.  To start, locate the design on the web site and do wnload it.  It’ll arrive on your computer as a 
.zip file, which you need to extract. Just righ t-click the file and choose Extract All.  You can 
now click into the folder, within  which will be another folder called Hot Gray.  Within there 
will be files you actually need: 
 
 
 
The license.txt file is a text file which spells out what you can and can’t do with this particular design.  Although most of the free web designs ha ve licences and restrictions, the restrictions 
are rarely tough.  In the case of Hot Gray, the licence file merely stipulates:  
Ok, I'm gonna be straight here, no legalese: this theme is free for personal and commercial 
use as long as the footer links are kept intact. 
 
You don't have to link from every page of your site if you don't want to, only the front page. 
 
Sounds perfectly acceptable to me.  So, copy the Hot Gray folder to your Web Work folder in 
order to keep all of your web-re lated projects in one place.  Then double-click the index.html 
icon so we can see what the page actually looks like in a web browser:

Looking pretty good so far, considering that we haven’t had to actually do any design work at 
all.  This is more like it! 
Tweaking the Text 
 
Changing the sample text that’s on the index.ht ml page supplied as standard is simplicity 
itself.  Load the file into Amaya, and just type over what’s already there.  Delete anything that 
you don’t want.  
In the example below, I’ve replaced the main text with a paragraph of my own.  In addition, I’ve created a short list of foods, and used the Unordered List option in  Amaya (the button on 
the right hand panel that I have ringed in red) to  format the list in the style as defined in the 
css file.  In this case, for the Hot Gray desi gn, the normal rounded bullets are replaced by 
small rectangles. 
 
I’ve also deleted the "Posted on…" line under the main heading.  This is useful for blog-type pages or online newsletters but isn’t really nece ssary here. The relevant entries are still in the 
CSS file, so this particular style can still be us ed on other pages within the site if required 
later.

Changing the Pictures 
 
You’ll also see from the picture above that I’ve changed the header picture from a desert 
scene to some tasty roast beef.  How was this do ne?  Take a look inside the images folder of 
your Hot Gray design.  Browsing in thumbnail mode within Windows, we find the following: 
 
 
 The 40original and blockgradient images are used to make up the border around the page, and the grey bars behind the menu lines.  We can leave these alone for now.  The file we’re 
interested in is header.jpg.  Hovering the mouse over the thumbnail brings up a summary 
box which tells us that the image is 760 by 122 pixels.   So, in order to customise the design 
but without affecting the layout, we simply need  to replace this image with something else 
that has the same name and is the same size .  A quick visit to the free image site at 
www.sxc.hu  that was mentioned earlier is all that’s required.

You’ll also need to crop the picture you download to a size of 760 by 122.   If you don’t have a 
program that can edit and crop pictures, search the web for The Gimp, which is a great image 
editor that’s totally free. Or use the online image editor at www.piknik.com . 
Changing the CSS Styles 
 
If you want to change the text styles that the Hot Gray design uses, you’ll need to change the 
CSS entries in its style sheet file.  Loading the css file into TopStyle Lite, the first section 
looks like this:  
 
 
Scroll down and you get to the next set of styles, namely:

There are others, too, but this will suffice for the moment.  Let’s take a look at some of these 
style definitions, and decipher what they mean.  
First is the style for the contents of the <body> tag, which governs some of the overall look 
for the entire page.  We can see, for example, that the background image is specified here.  The "repeat" bit means that, although the image itself is small, it will be tiled across the 
entire page as needed.  Next, the file specifies that headings 1 to 4 have  no margin or padding, and are in bold type. 
 Next, we set margins around each paragraph (i e, the <p> tag).  But why 8px and 5px?  You 
can specify up to 4 values in instances such as this, to affect margins,  padding etc all around 
an item.  The 4 values start from the top and work clockwise around it.  So, for example, a 
margin of 4px 7px 10px 3px   means 4 pixels at the top, 7 to the right, 10 underneath and 
3 pixels to the left.  In this case, only the first two values have been specified, so each 
paragraph will have an 8 pixel margin above it and 5 pixels to the right. 
 
The <a> tag stands for "anchor", and is the one we use for creating hyperlinks.  In the style 
definition for the <a> tag, text-decoration: none is how we remove the underline that

browsers otherwise add to links.  Equally, we change the standard link colour from blue to 
red with the  color: #990000 line. 
 
The a:visited and a:hover styles allow you to specify the style for links that the user has 
already visited.  Most browsers normally disp lay these in purple, but by setting a style for 
a:visited you can change this.  Equally, a:hover is the style that a hyperlink has when the 
visitor has his or her mouse hovered over it.  In this case, we use the <a> style to turn off the 
underline and then use a hover style to turn it back on.  This gives the effect of making the 
underline appear only when the mouse is hovered over the link.  
Which Style Is This? 
 
One of the problems that you’ll almost certainl y encounter when you’re trying to decipher 
how the sample index.html page and the style.css file work together, is how to tell which style 
or styles are governing the appearance of a cert ain item on the page.  For example, look at 
the screenshot above, where I’ve added the "Welcome to my site" heading.  Now look across 
to the Categories subheading on the left hand side of the screen, and particularly the "Web 
Development" line.  If you wanted to change the appearance of that text, which entry in the 
css file would you need to change? 
 In an ideal world, the structure and content of  the css file would tell  you all you need to 
know.  And indeed there’s a section in the file called #links, which, if  you remember our first 
lesson on CSS, means that this is the style for the item on the page which has an id of "links".  
There is indeed such an item, namely a tag that consists of <div id="links"> , but this, if 
you look through the HTML code of the index page, clearly refers to the links under the 
Pages heading and not the entries under the Categories heading.  So it’s back to square one. 
 
There are two techniques that can help you track down the css entry that affects an item on 
the page.  Firstly, use Amaya’s status line.  Load Amaya, open the page in question, place your cursor somewhere within the text that you’ re interested in, and look at the very bottom 
of the screen.  In the case of the page in question, you’ll see this:

The status line shows the hierarchy of HTML tags leading up to the item on which the cursor 
is positioned.  So in this case, it’s the overall HTML tag, followed by body, then a selection of 
divs, then a div which is configured to use a class called "block".  Within that div, we’re 
looking for an unordered list, and  list item wi thin that, and a hyperlink (the <a> tag) within 
that.  The second technique is to look at the HTML code near the text you’re interested in.  View 
t h e  H T ML  so u r c e  w i t h  A m a y a  ( o r  e v e n  l o a d  i t i n t o  W o r d P a d  o r  N o te p a d ,  i f  y o u ’ d  r a t h e r ).   
Search for "Web Development" and what you actually see is:  
 
 As we can see again the Web Development entry is a link within a list item, within an unordered list, within a div that is to be fo rmatted with the css cl ass called "block".   
 Although this looks cut and dried, it’s not necess arily the end of the story.  If you look further 
at the HTML source code, you will see that th e above-mentioned div is actually contained 
entirely within another div that has an id of "menu", and that div itself is within yet another one called "contentwrapper".  An y or all of which could be affecting our text, but at least we 
have some good clues as to wh ere to look in the css file. 
 Let’s start with the entry at the very end of  Am aya’s status line, and work backwards.  It’s an 
<a > ta g.   The  css file  ha s only one m e ntion of the  <a > ta g, so tha t’ s a  g ood pl a ce  to sta rt.

Let’s change the entry from color: #990000  to color: #009900 and try viewing our 
index page again: 
 
 
 
Success!  Our links are no w green rather than red. 
Adding Pages and Navigation 
 
With our downloaded template no w tweaked so that it looks how we want, all that remains is 
to create additional pages and get the navigation  (ie, the set of links down the left hand side) 
working.  
When you download a template that includes links, it’s common for those links not to 
actually lead anywhere when clicked.  If you look at the HTML source code for the page, and specifically the <a> tags which comprise the link s, you’ll see lines that look  something like 
<a href="#">   o r  <a href="/"> .  The entry in quotes after the href command is the 
destination for the link, and would normally co mprise a complete URL or at least an HTML 
file name.  Instead, these links are all empty so we need to populate them. 
 
First, we need to decide on the structure of our site.  We don’t need the Categories section, so 
that can be deleted.  In the Pages section, we’ll keep the first 3 (Home, Contact Us and About 
Us).  We’ll delete the last 2, and replace them with a new entry called Blog.

 We’re about to delete an entire section of the page, which starts with a <div> tag and ends 
with </div> .  Don’t delete the second of the two </div> tags, as that closes a div which is

correctly. 
 Press Backspace to delete the selected block of code, then save the HTML file.  Open the page

That’s the text of the links. Now we just need to set up the destinations.  So, in Amaya’s page 
view (you can close the source code view for now), click somewhere on the green Home link 
and then, from the Links menu, choose Create Or Change Link.  In the box, change the 
destination to index.html, as that’s our home page. 
 
Change the Contact Us link to point to contact. html in the same way, and the About Us link 
to point to about.html too.  Finally, set the Blog link to blog.html as well. 
 
All that remains is to actually create the pages that we’ve now started referring to.  So use the

Rules, Tables and Image Maps 
 
Now that you’re building up your knowledge of HTML in order to create web pages, and the use of CSS to specify how each HTML tag looks, we’ll cover three more features of web pages 
that you might find useful. 
Horizontal Rules 
 A horizontal rule allows you to create a line ac ross your web page.  This is useful as a way of 
underlining headings, or to sepa rate areas of a large page.  Al though, if a page is becoming 
particularly large, it’s always better to split it into multiple pages in order to save your 
visitors’ time and bandwidth. For example, if you’re putting together the web site for your 
school’s sports day and there’s a huge list of ra ce times that requires visitors to scroll down 
the page in order to find their name, split the pa ge into separate parts.  "Click here if your 
surname begins with A-K, or here for L-R, or here for S-Z".  Afte r all, Smith is unlikely to be 
interested in Brown’s results, so don’t waste his time including them on the same page.   
 
The standard HTML tag for a horizontal rule is ju st <hr>.   Because this tag doesn’t officially 
need to be closed, and yet modern HTML coding standards say that every tag needs to be 
closed, it’s good practice to use the ve rsion which includes a closure.  Namely <hr /> rather 
than a plain <hr>.  It’ll help ensure that your pages validate correctly. 
 
Amaya has the built-in ability to c re a te  r u l e s .   J u s t  l o a d  o n e  o f  y o u r  p a g e s,  t h e n  g o  t o  t h e

In a browser, such as Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox, it will look similar.  Possibly not 
identical, because each browser shows the stan dard <hr> rule in a different way, but the 
differences will only be minor.  For example, the line may be a slightly different colour or thickness.  
As with every HTML tag, to stamp your own design on it you need to use CSS.  For example, 
add this to your CSS file:  
hr { 
width: 400px; } 
 
and your horizontal lines now be come 400 pixels wide, rather th an filling the entire width of 
the screen.  Like so:

As always, if you want one particular line to be a different width, use an id-based selector.  
Eg, create a line like this:  
<hr id="special_line"> 
 
and then create a style called #special_line  which contains the specific information for 
this line. 
Tables 
 
A table is useful if you want to present ta bular information on a web page, such as a 
timetable, price list and so on.  To create a ta ble on a web page using Amaya, go to the Insert 
menu, choose Table, then choose Insert A Table.  In the box that appears, choose the number of rows and columns that you want, and the border thickness.  Here’s what Amaya looks like, 
after I inserted a table of 3 columns and 2 rows, with a border thickness of 1:

I’ve used Amaya to split the screen to show the table as it would normally appear in a 
visitor’s browser, and also the HTML code th at Amaya has generated.  You can now see the 
HTML tags that are relevant to tables, which you need to know in order to be able to control the appearance of your tables with CSS.  
The table starts with a <table> tag and, of course, ends with </table>.  The table’s caption, 
had I chosen to include one, would have been placed between the <caption> and </caption> tags.  By applying CSS to the caption tag, you can thus choose the particular font etc that you 
wish to use for your table captions.  The <col> tags are used to specify various characteristics for each of the columns of the table.  
The tags above, as generated by Amaya, don’t actually have any effect because there are no 
additional parameters specified.  It’s easiest, and perfectly safe, to ignore them. 
 
Next comes the main body of the table, which is enclosed within a <tbody> and </tbody> 
tag.  Within the table body, each table row go es between a <tr> and </tr> tag, and each cell 
is created with a <td> tag, which stands for Table Data. 
 
To change the overall look of all tables on a page, use your CSS file to apply one or more 
styles to the <table> tag.  This is where you ch ange things such as overall border line colours 
and thicknesses, the margin and padding betwee n and around each cell, and so on.  Styling

the <tr> tag, meanwhile, lets you specify vari ous aspects of table rows, and specifying the 
<td> tag in your CSS file lets yo u style the table cells themselves. 
 
As always, you can use id-based styles if you wa nt to change the appearance of just one row 
or cell.  For example, change  <td>Robert</td>  to <td id=robert-
cell>Robert</td> and you can now specify a unique st yle for the particular HTML item 
w h o s e  i d  i s  r o b e r t - c e l l .   J u s t  c r e a t e  a n  i d - b ased style with TopStyle Lite and specify the 
required id, as explained on page 75.  
 Another useful table-related tag is <th>.  This stands for Table Header, and is often used in 
place of <td> tags for each of the cells in the top row of a table.  By applying different styles to <th> and <td>, you can easily create a different look for your header row.  For example, add a background colour, make the text slightly larger, or make it bold. 
Image Maps 
 On page 84 we saw how to add a picture, or image, to a Web page using the <img> tag.  In 
the same chapter, we saw how images can also be used as hyperlinks, so that  a visitor to your 
site can click on an image, just like some text , to be taken to another part of the Web.   
 Now that you know about images and links, we  can introduce another, advanced feature of 
HTML which is known as an image map.  This allows you to divide an image into a number of separate areas, and specify a diffe rent link destination for each area. 
 
For example, let’s say that you are creating a web site that offers various items of clothing for 
sale.  You place a picture on your home page that shows someone dressed in shoes, trousers, 
t-shirt, scarf and hat.  You want to allow your visitors to click on part of the picture and be 
taken to different pages of your web site, na mely shoes.html, trousers.html, tshirts.html, 
scarves.html or hats.html.   
 
You might think that achieving th is feat involves loading the picture into an image editing 
program and dividing it into five separate files,  but actually you’d be wrong.  The picture can 
remain intact.  What you need to create is an Image Map, which is a spec ial collection of data 
items which specify the boundary co-ordinates of each clickable area of the image, as well as 
details of the link destination.  For example, "i f someone clicks within the square that starts 
in the top left-hand corner and whose lower ri g h t  h a n d  c o r n e r  i s  3 8  p i x e l s  d o w n  a n d  2 9  
pixels across, take them to trousers.html".  You then include this image map data within  the HTML code of your Web page, and the 
image can now be clicked in differe nt areas for different results.

Unfortunately Amaya can’t create image maps, but there are a few free programs on the

and the good news is that, li ke all of the software mentio ned in this book, it’s free. 
 
Once you’ve download the file and installed it, yo u can run it.  Start by clicking on its folder 
icon to open one of your pictures.  Then click on the shapes to define areas of the screen, and 
enter the URLs that correspond to the intended web destinations.  When you’re finished, 
click the Place On Clipboard button, which creates the map data and copies it to the Windows clipboard.  You can then paste it into your web page. 
 
The HTML code for using an image map looks like this: 
 
<IMG SRC="computer.jpg" USEMAP="#computer"> 
 <map name="computer"> 
Paste your image map data here 
</map> 
 
As you can see, it’s all pretty straightforwar d.  Add a USEMAP parameter to the <img> tag, 
which names the image map to be used.  Then place the map data somewhere on the page 
between a <map> tag and a </map> tag.  The map data can simply be pasted from the 
clipboard, having been generated with Handy Image Mapper as described above. 
 Here’s how Handy Image Mapper looks during use, once you’ve loaded a picture:

In this example, I’ve loaded computer.jpg and, using the controls at the top of the right-hand 
column, created a square area that links to screen.html and a round area that links to 
mouse.html. 
 
With this done, I can paste the map data in to Amaya.  The map data, in case you’re 
interested, consists of: 
 
<MAP NAME="map1"> 
<AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="25,8,81,52" HREF="screen.html" TITLE=""> <AREA SHAPE="CIRCLE" COORDS="69,104,16" HREF="mouse.html" TITLE=""> 
</MAP> 
 
Obviously you’ll need to change the name from  map1 to match whatever you have specified 
in the picture’s <img> tag.

Password-Protecting your Web Pages 
 
Most web sites are openly available to anyone wh o knows, or finds, the URL.   Most of the 
time, that’s the way you want it to be.   Bu t occasionally you will want to password-protect 
some or all of your pages.  For example, if yo u run the web site for a club or a school, you’ll 
want to restrict certain areas to members or students only.  Or perhaps your site contains 
information that has a value, such as documents or pictures, and you need to ensure that it’s 
only viewable to your paying customers.  Password-protecting one or more areas on your web site is actually a fairly easy task to 
accomplish, because there’s a faci lity built into most web servers. You don’t even need to do 
any programming.  
 
The key to protecting your pages in this way is  to know about two special text files called 
.htaccess and .htpasswd.  The first file, .hta ccess, contains some special commands for the 
web server which basically say "please don’t show anyone the pages in this folder unless they 
enter a correct username and password.  And here  is where you’ll find the list of usernames 
and passwords".  As you’ve probably guessed, th e second file, .htpasswd, contains the actual 
list of usernames and passwords.  All that you need to do in order to protect your site, 
therefore, is to create these two files and then  use your FTP program to upload them to the 
web server.   
 
Almost all web servers support this feature.  If you’re not sure whether yours does, you’ve 
nothing to lose by trying.   If your web brow ser pops up a username and password box at the 
appropriate point, you’re in bu siness.  If it doesn’t, and si mply shows you the pages without 
asking you to log in, it’s back to square one.   Or you need to ask your hosting company to 
enable the facility, as some of them don't turn it on by default. 
 
The remainder of this chapter shows you how to  create the .htaccess and .htpasswd files. 
Note, by the way, the dot at the front of the file name.  You’re probably used to seeing dots in 
filenames, such as letter.doc or finances.xls, but these two files are special as there’s nothing 
before the dot.  Web servers generally won’t ob ject to filenames in this format, but some 
desktop computers might.  If yours does, and yo u have trouble creating files with these weird 
names, just call them something a little less we ird when you first create them on your PC.  
Then, once they’re uploaded to the web server, use your FTP program to rename the 
uploaded versions in situ . 
The .htaccess File 
 The .htaccess file is used to provide special instructions to a web server.  It can be used for many purposes. For example, you can use a .hta ccess file to customise the error messages

that visitors see if there’s a prob lem with your site.  If a visitor attempts to surf to a page that 
doesn’t exist, or if they click on a link that doesn’t actually lead anywhere, they’ll normally 
s e e  a n  " E r r o r  4 0 4 "  p a g e .   T h i s  i s  g e n e r a t e d  b y  t h e  v i s i t o r ’ s  w e b  b r o w s e r .   B u t  b y  u s i n g  a  .htaccess file you can create and specify a customis ed error page instead.  Just create it as a 
standard web page, upload that page to the se rver, and then use a .htaccess file to tell the 
server where the page is.  
The other main use for a .htaccess file is pass word protection.  For such purposes, the file 
needs to look something like this: 
 
AuthType Basic 
AuthName "test" AuthUserFile "/home/thewebbo/.htpasswds/.htpasswd" 
require valid-user 
 
The first line tells the web serv er that you want to use HTTP Basic Authentication, which is 
the official name of the password protection feature that is the subject of this chapter.  The second line is where you specify the text message that appears in the password entry box that 
pops up on visitors’ screens.  You’ll see it in action shortly.  The final line, require valid-
user, tells the web server that it should deny access to everyone except those who can 
provide a valid username and password. 
 
The most important line is clearly the third one.   This contains the location of the .htpasswd 
file, which is where the list of valid usernames and passwords is stored.  It’s important to get 
this location right, or people won’t be able to access your protected pages.  However, the 
precise format varies greatly and is generally spec ific to each hosting provider.  You’ll need to 
search your host’s online support pages for te rms such as "htpasswd path" in order to find 
out the details. 
 
In the example above, I’ve used the version that is correct for Hostmonster, the company 
that’s hosting my the-web-book.com  s i t e .   T h i s  s t a r t s  w i t h  / h o m e ,  t h e n  c o m e s  m y  
username, then a folder called .htpasswds and then the file name itself (.htpasswd).  
 It doesn’t normally matter where you put the .h tpasswd file, so long as you use the .htaccess 
file to tell the server where you put it.  But in  the case of our hosting company, hostmonster, 
they impose a rule that all such files have to go in the .htpasswds folder.  If you look at the hierarchical tree of folders that FileZilla displays, you’ll see that .htpasswds is not within the 
public_html folder.  Although you can still ac cess the .htpasswds folder with your FTP 
program, as owner of the site, visitors ca n’t access it with their web browser.

ensuring that files which visitors don’t need to  surf to are not put in public_html.  And for 
obvious reasons, you really don’t want visitors to try surfing to, and attempting to download, 
your .htpasswds file. Hence Hostmonster’s insistence that you don’t put it in public_html.  If 
you do, the feature won’t work. 
 
To start password-protecting your web site, use FileZilla to create a new folder on the site, within public_html, called privat e.  In that folder, create an d upload a simple test page.  
Then type the example .htaccess file shown above, into a text file, call it  .htaccess, and upload 
that into your private folder too. 
The .htpasswd File 
 
We’ve created a private folder, placed a sample page in there, and used a .htaccess file to tell 
the web server where the list of usernames and pa sswords is.  All that re mains is to actually 
create that list of usernames and passwo rds. In other words, the .htpasswd file. 
 A .htpasswd file is merely a text file of usernames and passwords, with each pair on a 
separate line and with a colon between the usernames and passwords.  Here’s an example 
(but don’t bother trying it yet, for reasons that will be explained shortly): 
 
fred:flintstone 
open:sesame 
 
In this case, it would create two valid users (fred and open) with passwords of flintsone and 
sesame respectively.  However, it’s not quite  as simple as that! 
  If you were allowed to create th e file as shown above, it would represent a significant security 
risk.  Anyone who managed to hack into your web site and download the file would now have 
a list of every username and password on the syste m.  Clearly not ideal, or remotely sensible. 
 
So for added security, here’s how the feature actu ally works.  Instead of  creating a line that 
consists of, say, open:sesame , you encrypt the password in advance, thus the line becomes: 
 
open:$apr1$kZy1b/..$BM8fLekWkKblQ6pynXeM/1 
 
When the user types in their password, the web server encrypts it and compares it to the 
version in the .htpasswd file.  If both of the encrypted passwords match, then the original, 
unencrypted ones must also match too (don’t worry, they just do, trust me).   
 
The encryption algorithm (formula) used for encrypting .htaccess passwords is a standard 
feature that almost every web server supports.  It works because the encryption is a one-way

process.  Turning sesame into $apr1$kZy1b/ ..$BM8fLekWkKblQ6pynXe M/1 is very easy.  
Trying to reverse the process, however, is much  more difficult.  Not im possible, but certainly 
difficult enough to provide another level of security for your protected pages. 
 
All that remains, therefore, before you can create a proper .htaccess file, is for you to find a 
way of encrypting passwords in the correct way, ie the way that web servers expect.  There are lots of programs that are capable of doin g it, which you can download from the internet 
for free.  Even easier, there are websites that will do the encryption for you.  They’re quite safe to use, as they won’t know what we b site you’re creating the passwords for. 
 
A Google search for "htpasswd generator" will lead  you to a choice of sites,  which will look 
something like this one: 
 
 
 Type in the username and password of your choi ce, and the site will generate the line that 
needs to be added to your .htpasswd  file.  Then  just copy and paste it in, using a simple text 
editor like Notepad or WordPad.   
When you’re done, use FileZilla to upload .htpasswd to the .htpasswds folder of your web site 
(or wherever else you decide to put it, accord ing to what your hosting company allows).

Notice the "test" message, as specified in the .htpasswd file.  We could (and probably should 
have) just as easily specified a more friendly message, such as "Please log into the site".  Keep typing wrong usernames or passwords, and nothing happe ns.  The password entry box 
keeps re-appearing.  But as soon as you suppl y one of the correct username/password pairs, 
the protected page is displayed.    Once the us er is "logged in" like this, access to all pages 
within the protected folder on the server (ie, the one which contains the .htaccess file) will be 
allowed without the user needing to re-enter their password.  
Protecting Multiple Folders 
 
If you want to protect more than one folder on your site, you can do that in 2 different ways.  
If you want to use the same set of usernames and passwords for all of the protected folders, 
just put a copy of the same .htaccess file in each of the folders, which all point to the same .htpasswd file.  If you want to use different  usernames and passwords, then each protected 
folder will need its own .htaccess file, which poin ts to a unique .htaccess file.  In the case of 
Hostmonster, those files must a ll reside in the .htpasswds fold er, but the name of the file 
itself can vary.  So you could, for example, ha ve separate files called  .htpasswd1, .htpasswd2 
and so on, pointed to by co mplementary .htaccess files.

CMSes and Other Software 
 
By now, assuming you’ve read every page of this book, you’ll know pr etty much everything 
that’s required to create simple Web pages from scratch.  This includes registering a domain 
name, renting some space on a web server, an d creating pages using HTML for the content 
and CSS for the layout. 
 
With this basic knowledge under your belt, it’s time to make an important decision.  Will you 
continue to create web sites in this way, wher e  e a c h  p a g e  i s  a n  H T M L  f i l e  t h a t  h a s  t o  b e  
edited and uploaded?  Or will you do things The Other Way? 
 
T o  u n d e r s t a n d  w h a t  w e  m e a n  b y  T h e  O t h e r  Way, consider modern web sites such as 
Facebook, WordPress, LinkedIn, Bebo, Twitter, MySpace and Ebay.  These are often referred 
to as Web 2.0 sites, but what does this mean exactly? 
 When you want to update your profile on Face book, you don’t have to create an HTML file 
with Amaya and then use an FTP program to upload it.  You just fire up your web browser, connect to the site, log in with a username an d password, and manage your content directly 
within the site itself.  It’s the same whethe r you’re posting a new page to your blog on 
w o r d p r e s s . c o m ,  c r e a t i n g  a n  i t e m  f o r  s a l e  on eBay, or using any of the other sites I 
mentioned.  How do they do that?  And more importantly, can anyone do it?  Can you create sites that work in a similar way, that you ca n update directly from a browser without the 
need for an HTML editor or an FTP tool?  You may be surprised to know that creating a Web 2.0 site isn’t actually difficult.  Mainly 
because the software that allows you to do it is available  from various places.  All you need to do is obtain it, install it on your hosting sp ace, and start using your Web 2.0 site.  Even 
better, many of the most popular programs are what’s known as FOSS (free, open-source 
software).  This means that, not only are they  completely free of ch arge, you also get the 
program source code so you can modify it if it doesn’t quite fit your needs. 
 
The key to creating a Web 2.0 site, ie one that you can edit and maintain from within a web 
browser without the need for pr ograms like Amaya and FileZilla, are two technologies known 
as server-side programming languages and server-side database engines.  The former lets 
you write programs which run on the Web server.  One of the things that these programs can 
d o  i s  t o  r e t ri e v e  te x t  f r o m  a  d a ta b a se  a n d  p r esent it in a web browser, which is where the 
second technology comes in.  
We’ll learn how to use these technologies in much more detail during the forthcoming chapters in this book.  There, we’ll learn ho w to write programs using the PHP language, and 
access databases that use the My SQL database engine.  This will allow us to create our own

web-based applications, including those that work in the same way as Facebook and all the 
other Web 2.0 sites mentioned above. 
 But if you want to create a Web 2.0 site that performs a common functi on, such as a blog, or 
a discussion forum, or a simple web site, or a picture gallery, then here’s the good news.  
There are lots of ready-made open source applic ations.  Just install on e or more of them on 
your hosting space and you’re ready to roll. 
 
A Web 2.0 application that performs the basic functions of creating and maintaining a 
standard web site is known as a Content Mana gement System, or CMS.   Sometimes the term 
used is WCMS, or Web Content Management System.  As I said, we’ll leave the precise 
details, including how to write one using PHP an d MySQL, until later.  For now, let me show 
you just how useful the existing, free, ready-made applications are, and how easy they are to 
get up and running. 
 Note that this chapter isn’t an in-depth tutori al on how to use the products mentioned.  If 
you decide that any or all of them would be a us eful addition to your site, use what follows as 
a starting point and then search online for documents and forums that help you get your system working (and properly secured) the way you want. 
 
For the purposes of this chapter we’re going to install and configure 4 different products: 
 
• Joomla - One of the leading free WCMS products 
• Wordpress - Another leading CMS, especially good for blog sites 
• phpBB - A discussion forum 
• Plogger - A picture gallery 
 
There are, of course, many other free, open source web applications in addition to those 
detailed here.  There are literally hundreds availa ble, in many other categories. If you want to 
sell things via your web site, for example, there’s a free e-commerce suite called oscommerce.  
If you want to set up your own version of wikipe dia, there are dozens of free wiki applications 
available.  One great place to find Web software is www.hotscripts.com , which offers 
ready-made applications in a number of categories .  Here’s just one part of one of their menu 
screens, showing the huge number of programs available, all for free.

CMSes and Templates 
 
CMS products like Joomla and WordPress ar e template-based.  Yo u start with a basic 
template, or page layout, which contains common elements such as a logo, the site’s title, the 
page footer and so on.  The template also cont ains markers (called placeholders) to indicate 
where the unique content for each page should be inserted.  For example, the main heading, 
the intro paragraph, the main body text , the name of the author, and so on. 
 Key to using a CMS is to create a template.  Th ankfully, there are lots of free ones available, 
which can change the look of your site instantl y.  But if you don’t like any of the standard 
templates, you can edit the existing ones or design your own from scratch.  Any HTML page can be turned into a CMS template – it’s just a case of looking through the CMS documentation for details on ho w to insert those special markers at the point where you 
want each page’s content to appear.  If you like designing HTML page s, perhaps to be used as CM S templates, one product that 
deserves a mention is Xara Web Designer.  It’s not free, but is only around £39 or $60.  It contains more than 700 ready-made page templa tes, easily adaptable for use with any CMS,

and it’s incredibly easy to use.  It allows you to do things that no other HTML editor does.  
For example, here’s one of the program’s standard designs: 
 
 
 Now, just type over any of the text or buttons in order to customise the page.  Or click one of 
the coloured diamonds to change the entire colo ur scheme.  You can also click on any object 
(a paragraph, a picture, a button etc) and, with your mouse, move it, enlarge it, or rotate it, just like any PC-based drawing program.  When you’re done, just save the file and you’ve got 
yourself an HTML page which can be used as-is on a site or converted to a CMS template. 
 
Also, if you're using Joomla or Wordpress, ch eck out a commercial product called Artisteer, 
which makes it easy to create great-looking template files. You can read more, and see a 
demo video, at www.artisteer.com . 
Automatic Installers 
 
In the chapters that follow, I’ll show you how to obtain, install and configure Joomla, 
Wordpress, phpBB, and Plogger.  But before yo u read these sections in detail, check whether 
your web host offers you the use of an au tomatic installer such as Fantastico or 
SimpleScripts.  If so, then your life just got even easier.  These systems let you install many of 
the leading free web applications in seconds, with just a single click.

If the facility is available, and if you want to  go down the easy route rather than learning how 
to install and configure the programs from scratch, then it makes good sense to use it.  Just 
check on your web hosting control panel to see if the feature is available.  
As an example, here’s the main SimpleScripts menu, which shows all of the applications that 
it can install.  You can then install any of them  into your hosting space with just one click, 
and be up and running in just seconds:

Although it’s easy to install applications into yo ur hosting space, and even more so if you use 
SimpleScripts or Fantastico, the process sti ll takes time.  Plus, if you don’t like the 
application, you have to spend more time uninsta lling it.  The best way round this is to find a 
site that already has a copy of the application installed, and which allows you to log into it 
and use it for test purposes.  Then, when you know it’s what you want, you can set up your 
own copy in your own hosting space.  
My favourite online resource for testing open  source Web applications in this way is 
www.opensourcecms.com . Despite the name, it doesn’t just cover CMSes.  It also includes 
forums, wikis, and more.  The site is completely free to use, and offers links to installed demo 
copies of dozens of products. You even get supplied with the admin passwords, so you can 
experience the installed product as an owner rather than just a user.  Which means, for 
example, that you can create new pages on the CMS rather than just reading what’s already 
there.  For obvious security reasons, a few features are automatically disabl ed, such as sending 
email or changing the admin password.  Also, the entire system is automatically deleted and reinstalled every couple of hours so any mali cious content won’t be around for long.  But 
opensourcecms.com should definitely be your firs t port of call if you’re  considering installing 
such a product into your hosting space.  If the product you want to install isn’t listed on opensourcecms.com, all is not lost.  Check 
out the product’s home site on the Web.  Many offer a test version that you can log into (look for a Demo or Online Demo link), and this often includes the admin passwords so you can 
check out the management facilities too. 
A Word about Patching 
 The key to security on any Windows PC is to ensure that automatic updates are enabled.  
Microsoft issues around 100 security fixes ea ch year for Windows, many of which are for 
bugs that are so serious they could allow ever yone in the world to access your files via the 
internet.  By ensuring that these patches are downloaded and installed automatically, you prevent your PC from serious attack. 
 
But Windows is not unique.   Every program has security bugs, and every team of developers 
issues regular security patches for its products .  The people who develop products such as 
Joomla, phpBB, and all of the other web-based software mentioned here, are no exception.  
The difference between Windows and these products, however, is that there’s no Automatic Updates feature.  Therefore, if you install a pr oduct on your Web server, it’s vitally important 
that you check the product’s web site every couple of months to find out whether any important security updates have been issued.  If  they have, you’ll need to download them and

normally amount to nothing more than uplo ading the files to your server via FTP to 
overwrite the versions already there. 
 
Failure to carry out this essent ial maintenance task will mean that your entire site is 
potentially liable to attack by hackers.  In some cases, this could mean that hackers can wipe 
or corrupt the content database which holds all of your CMS web pages, or all of your forum 
messages. 
Setting Up A Database 
 All of the products that we’re about to install require a database on the server in order to 
store content such  as web pages, forum post ings, and information about images.  When you 
come to install and configure the products, you will be asked to provide details of a database 
that can be used.  Therefore, if you intend to install any of the products, you MUST first 
create a new database on your web server. 
 There are various web database technologies, but one of the most popular is MySQL.  In a 
later chapter I’ll show you how to create your  own programs that can store information in 
s e r v e r - b a s e d  d a t a b a s e s .   B u t  f o r  t h e  m o m e n t ,  a l l  w e  n e e d  t o  d o  i s  t o  c r e a t e  a n  e m p t y  
database for our products to use.

panel and not your domain name control panel.    Scroll down to the Databases section and click on MySQL Databases, and you’ll see a screen 
like this.  Of course, if you’re not using Hostmo nster, or if your host doesn’t use the cPanel 
control panel, your site won’t work in quite the same way as this, but the principle is always the same.

All that’s required is to type a name for our new database, and click the Create Database button. 
 
Rather than creating a database called joomla, pl ogger, or anything else that’s specific to one 
particular product, we’re going to call it cms instead.  We can then use this database not just 
with Joomla, but with all our other CMS, foru m and gallery products too (WordPress and so 
on).  Don’t worry – the data won’t get mixed up, for reasons that will become apparent later.  
But by having just one database for all of our CMS testing work, we gain  a couple of useful 
benefits: 
 
1. If your host only allows yo u a small number of databases, this is a great way around 
the limitation. 
2. When you’re finished testing CMSes, ther e’s only one database that you need to 
delete 
 So, go ahead and create the cms database.  cPan el does the job, and displays a confirmation:

Notice how the database that’s been created is  not actually the name we chose?  We chose 
cms but we’ve actually got one called thewebbo_c ms instead.  Why?  Because, like many 
hosting companies, Hostmonster adds your user n a m e  o r  s o m e  o t h e r  u n i q u e  i d e n t i f i e r  t o  
each database you cr eate.  Don’t worry about this, as it wo n’t be visible to your visitors.  But 
it’s very important to know about this, because it will affect what you need to tell the product 
when it asks for details of the database that you have set up fo r it to store its information in. 
 
Here’s a useful tip.  Whenever you need to connect to a MySQL database from your own PHP 
programs, or when you’re configuring third part y products such as Joomla, you’ll need to 
know the database host name, the database name, and the connection username and password.  So once you know these, and th ey work correctly, make a note of them 
somewhere.  You’ll need them often so it’s handy to have them in a convenient place.  But 
make sure you keep them secure – anyone who finds them could connect to your database 
via the web from anywhere in the world and delete or corrupt any web site that stores its data there. 
 
The database connection settings that will wo rk for us in the following examples are: 
 
Host:  localhost 
Database: thewebbo_cms Username: thewebbo 
Password: xxxxx 
 Setting the host name to "localhost" tells the program that the database server and the web 
server are the same machine.  In most cases,  that's the way it works. If your hosting 
company's database server uses a different name, you'll be informed. 
General Installation Procedures 
 
Although there are minor differences, the basic procedure for installing an open source 
product on your web server is as follows:  
1. Check that your server supports the main features (PHP and MySQL, for example) that the product requires.

2. Download the product from a web site, normally as a .zip file 
3. Check any README file which will contain ba sic details of the installation procedure 
and anything else that it’s important for you to know. 
4. Extract the zip file to your computer 
5. Create a folder (directory) on the web server 
6. Upload the product’s file s to the new directory 
7. Ensure that you have a MySQL database set up on the server for the product to use 
8. Surf to the product’s installation page, usin g a web browser, and fill in the details of 
the MySQL database.  Al so choose an admin username and password. 
9. Test the product by surfing to its main home page on your server. 
10. Occasionally refer back to the web site from where you downloaded the product, to 
check for important updates and security pa tches that you might need to install. 
 
Once you understand this basic procedure, you sh ould have little trouble installing any open 
source product such as a CMS, blog, image gallery, forum, wiki, and so on. 
Uninstalling 
 If you no longer need access to an open sour ce product that you’ve installed on your web 
server, uninstalling it is rarely  difficult. However, the process is almost always a manual one 
– there’s no "Add/Remove Programs" button on web servers, as there is in Windows.  At 
least, not unless you installed the product using an automated installer such as Fantastico or 
SimpleScripts. 
 
Thankfully, uninstalling a product such as a CMS, forum, gallery etc is no rmally just a case of 
doing the following: 
 
1. Check the product’s documentation or official website to find out whether there are any special actions you need to take  in addition to the steps below. 
2. Use your web hosting control panel to delete the database that the product uses.  If 
you wish, export the contents of the tables to a backup file first. 
3. Delete the product’s directory on the server. 
 In the majority of cases, that’s all you need to do.

Joomla 
 
Joomla (officially known as Joomla!, complete with exclamation mark ) is the best-known 
and most widely used of the open source CMS products.  Its widespread adoption means that 
the Web is awash with helpful documents, free add-ons, discussion forums and other 
resources to help you make the most of it.  For now, we’ll just create a basic installation so 
that you can appreciate the steps involved an d decide whether your site should use a CMS 
rather than consisting of separately-crafted HTML pages. 
 
The first step is to download the Joomla software from www.joomla.com .  This example 
uses version 1.5.10, but a later on e may be available by the time you read this.  Make sure you 
download the latest available version.  You’ll n eed the full installer rather than any upgrader 
that’s offered. 
 
You’ll end up with a zip file, which you need to unpack.  If you use WinZip or similar, follow your normal procedure.  If you don’t have such a program installed, Windows can unpack 
Zip files for you.  Just right-click the zip file and choose Extract All, to unpack the file into a separate folder.  You can then delete the zip file itself. 
Uploading the Files 
 You now need to upload the entire unpacked Joom la folder to the web server, using FileZilla.  
Start the program, and connect to your server.  In the folder list for the remote site, double-
click the public_html folder to open it:  
 
 In the same area, right-click public_html and choose Create Directory.  Name it /public_html/joomla and press OK.  You shou ld now have a folder (directory) within 
public_html called joomla.   Double-click on jo omla to open the folder, which will be empty. 
 Note that we created a folder called joomla rather than Joomla.  It’s accepted as best 
practice, whenever you create files or folders on a web site, to stick to lower case (small 
letters rather than capitals) throughout.  This is because, to a web server, capital and small

letters are different.  Thus a folder called Joomla is not the same as one called joomla, which 
could easily lead to errors if visitors were to type the wrong thing.  So to keep things simple, 
we stick to lower case throughout.  
With your joomla folder created and open on screen, we can now upload the system files into 
it.  On the left hand size of FileZilla’s window, in the local site section, navigate to the Joomla 
folder that you unpacked earlier, so that al l of the Joomla constituent folders and files 
(administrator, cache, components etc) are displayed.  
 
Click inside the window where they’re displayed, then press Ctrl-A to select everything.  Then 
press Return, and everything should be transfe rred from your computer to the server.  This 
will take a good few minutes, as there are around 4000 separate files to transfer.   When it’s 
done, you can delete all the files from your PC as they’re no longer required. 
Configuring Joomla 
 We can now go ahead and configure Joomla.  Us ing your web browser, surf to the Joomla 
installation that you copied to th e server earlier.  Assuming you uploaded it to a folder called 
joomla, the address will be www.yoursite.com/joomla  or something similar.  In my case, 
it’s www.the-web-book.com/joomla , which brings up a page like this:

Choose a language (English, presumably), and press the Next button, to begin the pre-
installation check.  Here, Joom la checks various things on your server, to ensure that you 
have the right versions of PHP (the programmin g language in which Joomla is written) and 
MySQL.  It also makes a number of other chec ks.  If any of these fails, check the support 
pages on your web host’s site in order to find out how to resolve the problem. 
 Here’s the page from my Joom la pre-installation check: 
 
 
 
The only warning is that the setting for Di splay Errors is turned on, where Joomla 
recommends that it’s turned off.  This is relatively minor.  It means that, if Joomla crashes, 
someone who’s visiting the site at the ti me might see an error message.  This is 
unprofessional, and a minor security risk.  We can live with this, so we’ll click the Next 
button and move on to the licence agreement  screen.  Read it, then click Next.  
Now comes the most important scre en, which is to do with our da tabase configuration.  Fill it 
in as follows:

In the Database Type box, choose MySQL.  
For the host name, type localhost.  This tells Joomla that the database server is the same 
machine as the web server.  This is not alwa ys the case – it depends on your web hosting 
company.  If you have problems making Joomla  work, check your host’s support site, or the 
email that was sent when you signed up, to fi nd out the address of your MySQL server.   
 
For the username and password, use the same ones that you use to connect to your hosting 
control panel. 
 For the database name, use the one that you created on page 124 (thewebbo_cms in this 
case).  Finally, go to the Advanced Settings box.  Tick the "delete existing tables" entry, just to be 
neat.  Choose joomla_ for the table prefix.  Within a MySQL database there can be more than one 
table, just as there can be multiple Excel spreadsheets within one workbook.  Joomla creates 
various tables for itself, to store sets of data such as web pages, user details, page counters 
and so on.  By specifying a table prefix, all of the Joomla-related tables within the database 
will be clearly identifiable because they have joomla_ at the start of their name.  When we

come on to install other products later, we’ll use a separate table prefix such as wordpress_ 
or plogger_.  This is the way that we can allow multiple programs to share one database – 
they all have their own tables wi th their own prefixes.  So even if both Joomla and Wordpress 
wanted to create a table called users, they’d actually end up being called joomla_users and 
wordpress_users, thus avoiding any conflicts. 
 With everything entered,  press the Next button. 
 Joomla now needs to know a username and pass word that it can use to communicate with 
your web server via FTP.  For the sake of simp licity, we’ll use our site-wide account that we 
use for accessing the control panel and the MySQL database: 
 
 
 Tick the box to enable the FTP layer, then en ter your site username and password again.  
Then, rather than filling on the FTP Root Path entry, just click the Autofind FTP Path button 
and Joomla will do the hard work for you.  In this case  the result is /public_html/joomla, which is what we’d expect.  
Almost there.  Just one more screen to go .  Click the Next button, and this appears:

Choose a name for your web site.  It doesn’ t matter what you choos e, as you can always 
change it later.  For now, I’ll call my site Robert’s Joomla Test.   
 
Enter your email address where asked, and then choose an admin password for your Joomla site.  The username will be admin (you can’t change this).  Make sure you remember this, as 
you’ll need it to log into your Joomla CMS to maintain or create pages.  In this demo site I’ve 
chosen a password of poltergeist.  
Before you go any further, click the Install Samp le Data button.  This will create some sample 
content in your CMS, rather than leaving you with an empty CMS that contains no pages at 
all.  Having done so, and with the "Sample da ta installed successfully" message displayed, 
click the Next button. 
 Hopefully, you should now have a working Joom la installation.  The final screen of the 
configuration section looks like this:

Before you can use Joomla, you need to heed the message and delete the installation folder from your web server.  This is a security precau tion.  If you don’t do this, someone could surf 
to that folder and re-install Joomla from scratch, just like we have done.  By choosing their own admin password, they could also lock you out of your own CMS.   
 
So, close your Web browser and open FileZilla.  Connect to your server.  On the right hand 
side of the screen, which shows the remote site, double-click on the public_html folder to 
open it.  Then open the joomla folder.  Then right-click on the instal lation folder and choose 
Delete.  Wait for a minute or two until FileZilla has finished deleting all of the files from the 
installation folder on the server, then close the program and return to your desktop. 
Your New Joomla Site 
 Right, hopefully our Joomla installation is now ready to use.  Surf to the folder where you 
installed it (eg, www.the-web-book.com/joomla  in our case) and you should see it in 
action:

You now have a fully-working, fu nctional web site based around the best-known open source 
CMS.  Click some of the links, and see all of the features that your new site has.  Remember 
that you can change all aspects of the site’s desi gn and features.  You don’t have to stick with 
the colours and design that are shown.  Equally, if you want to remove certain features such 
as the poll, you can do so.  And of course, the Joomla logo can easily be replaced with your 
own.  This chapter does not pretend to be an exhaus tive guide to creating smart-looking web sites 
with Joomla.  There are plenty of online tutorials that can help you do this, as well as lots of 
templates and skins that you can download in or der to change the visual appearance of your 
site.  For now, let’s finish this brief look at Joomla by logging into the administration system, 
so you can see how easy it is to create cont ent via a web browser without the need for an 
HTML editor or an FTP program.  
On the Resources menu on the left hand side of your screen, click the Administrator link.  
You’ll be asked for your username (admin, if  you remember) and password (poltergeist for 
our example here).  The main admin menu looks like this:

This is only a test installation, so why not just click on various features and see what they do?  
You won’t break anything.  If you do, and everythi ng goes horribly wrong, just use FileZilla to 
connect to the server, delete the entire Joomla  folder, then upload the files again and start 
afresh with a new installation.  So long as you click the option to delete any database tables 
that already exist, you won’t even have to create a new database. 
 
Let’s change something in the si te.  Click the Front Page Manager icon, and you’ll see a list of 
all the items that appear on the front page of the site.  Click the title of the first article 
(Joomla community portal) and an editing screen appears:

As you might be starting to realise, a CMS is a hugely flexible way of working but it’s still not 
particularly simple.  The sheer number of opti ons and menus on the main admin screen look 
daunting at first.  But it’s definitely worth pe rsevering, because it will save you time in the 
long run.  Once you’ve sorted out your design templates, you can create new pages in a flash and add them into the main body of your site in  just seconds.  Plus, because Joomla is very 
much based around templates, skins and CSS, it’s  easy to roll out a new design across all of 
your site without having to change each indi vidual page.  So go ahead and explore Joomla.

WordPress 
 
L i k e  J o o m l a ,  W o r d P r e s s  i s  a  f r e e ,  o p e n  s o u r c e  C M S .   A l t h o u g h  i t  i s  u s e d  n o w a d a y s  f o r  creating all sorts of general-pu rpose web sites, it was originally designed for use in blog 
publishing and it is in this area that it functions particul arly effectively.  
 As with Joomla, getting an installation of WordPress up and running isn’t particularly 
difficult.  The remainder of this  chapter will take you through each of the required steps in 
turn. 
Downloading the Software 
 
To obtain your copy of the WordPress software, visit www.wordpress.org  and download 
the .zip version of the software.  At the time of writing, the latest  release is version 2.7.1.  If 
there’s a later version available, use that one instead. 
 Once you’ve download the file, you need to unpack the zip file.  If you don’t know how to do 
this, refer to page 128.   O n c e  y o u ’ v e  u n p a c k e d  t h e  z i p  f i l e  i n t o  a  s e p a r a t e  f o l d e r ,  y o u  c a n  
delete the zip file itself. 
Make a Database 
 Next, you need to ensure that there’s a MySQ L database on your web server.  If you’ve 
already followed the instructions on page 124 for creating the thewebbo_cms database then 
it’s safe to proceed.  If not, go back and do that now.  
Configure WordPress 
 
Unlike Joomla, which you configure via the web after uploading the product to your server, 
WordPress is slightly different.  The configuration data is held in a text file which you need to 
edit before uploading anything.  
Browse through the folder of files that was cr eated when you extracted the zip file.  In the 
wordpress folder you’ll find a file called wp-config-sample.php, which you need to open.  Use 
a  t e x t  e d i t o r  s u c h  a s  W o r d P a d  o r  N o t e P a d .   DO NOT use a word processor like Microsoft 
Word, as it will save the file as a document ra ther than plain text, which won’t work.  If you 
really must use a word processor, save the file by choosing Save As from the File menu, and ensure that you choose the plain text option.

With the wp-config-sample.php file open in your  text editor, there are 2 sections you need to 
edit.  First, look for th is section in the file: 
 
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** // 
/** The name of the database for WordPress */ 
define('DB_NAME', 'putyourdbnamehere'); 
 
/** MySQL database username */ 
define('DB_USER', 'usernamehere'); 
 
/** MySQL database password */ 
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'yourpasswordhere'); 
 
/** MySQL hostname */ 
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost'); 
 
Change ‘putyourdbnamehere’ to the name of the MySQL database you created earlier.  In our case this will be ‘thewebbo_cms’. Note that the single quotes need to remain in place. 
 Change ‘usernamehere’ to your web hosting username.  In our case it’s ‘thewebbo’.  
Change ‘yourpasswordhere’ to your web hosting password.   
 You can probably leave ‘localhost’ as it is, unle ss your web hosting company tells you that its 
MySQL database server is located on a different computer, in which case you need to enter its details here in place of localhost.  It migh t be something like ‘mysql2.yourhost.com’.  But 
in our case, ‘localhost’ is what we need. 
 
Finally, scroll down the file and locate this section:  
/** 
 * WordPress Database Table prefix. 
 * 
 * You can have multiple installations in one database if you give each a 
unique 
 * prefix. Only numbers, letters, and underscores please! 
 */ 
$table_prefix  = 'wp_'; 
 
Note that our WordPress installation is config ure to add wp_ at the start of each of the 
MySQL database tables it creates.  That should suffice, so you can leave it alone.  Just make 
sure that a table prefix is set, and that the WordPress prefix isn’t the same as the prefix 
you’re using for any other product that you have  installed on your server.  Otherwise there 
will be problems when table names clash and two different programs attempt to access them.

With the configuration file edited, save it to yo ur hard disk as wp-config.php.  Your initial 
WordPress configuration is now complete.  Remember, you MUST save the file as wp-
config.php, without the word sample . 
Upload The Software 
 
You can now upload the WordPress folder from your computer to your web server.  Using 
FileZilla, connect to the server, double-click on  the public_html folder to open it, then right-
click to create a new directory (folder) within it called wordpress (no capital letters).  Then 
upload the entire contents of the WordPress folder .  It will take a minute or three to transfer 
all of the 600 files, after which you can delete  the WordPress files from your PC and exit 
FileZilla. 
Final Configuration 
 
To finish setting up your inst allation of WordPress,  open your web browser and surf to /wp-
admin/install.php within your WordPress installation folder.  So in this example, where we uploaded the files to the the-we b-book.com site in the wordpress folder, the full URL will be: 
 
http://www.the-web-book.com/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php 
 
Note that the public_html folder is never part of the URL of your site.  That’s where all the 
other folders start from. 
 
You should now see the following screen:

Choose a title for your blog, and enter your email address, then click the Install WordPress button.  Assuming that you edited the co nfig file correctly, and your database 
host/username/password were correct, this se cond configuration step should only take a 
couple of seconds.  After wh ich, you will see a username (usually admin) and a password 
displayed.  You’ll need these in order to log into  your blog to create and edit content, so make 
a careful note of the password.   You can now browse your blog (even though th ere’s not much in it yet), or log into the 
editing system to start creating content.   
To view your blog, the URL is www.yoursite.com/wordpress .  To log into the editing 
system, use www.yoursite.com/wordpress/wp-login.php  instead.

Obviously there’s a lot more to explore with Word Press.  For a start you’ll want to delete the

Feel free to experiment with the various feat ures, including the appearance of your blog.  
After all, this is your installation of WordPress running on your own hosting space, so you have total control over what you do with th e system.  Just remember to keep your admin 
password safe, so that no one but you can create or edit pages.

phpBB 
 
As part of your web site, you may want a disc ussion forum or two.  There are many open-
source forum programs that yo u can download for free and install on your web server in 
order to provide this. Possibly the best-known is phpBB, so that's what we'll use here. 
 Like a traditional CMS (Joomla, Wordpress etc) , forum software needs access to a database 
(MySQL is just fine) to store forum postings, user data and so on.  So before you go any 
further, make sure you have followed the procedure on page 124 to create the empty MySQL 
database.   
 
Once you’ve done this, go to www.phpbb.com  and download the software.  You’ll need the 
zip file version.  In this example we’re using release 3.0.4 but there may be a later revision available by the time you read  this.  If there is, use it. 
 Having downloaded the zip file, extract it to  your computer.  If you have a program such as 
WinZip installed, follow your normal procedure.   If you don’t, Windows should be able to 
extract the file for you – just right-click it and choose Extract All.  Once you’ve extracted it, you can delete the zip file from your computer .  All you need is the folder containing the 
extracted version. 
 
Next, we need to connect to our server with Fi leZilla and upload the extracted files.  Once 
you’re connected, double-click on the public_html folder to open it.  Then right-click on the 
opened public_html folder and choose Create Directory.  Make a directory (ie, a folder) 
called phpbb.  Once you’ve done this, double-click the phpbb folder and make sure that a) you’re in it, and b) it’s empty.  FileZilla’s  remote site window sh ould look like this:

In the left hand Local Site window, navigate to the extracted phpbb folder on your PC.  Select 
everything except the top ".." entry, and press Re turn to start the upload.  There are around 
900 files to transfer so it’ll take a good few mi nutes, depending on the speed of your internet 
connection. 
File Permissions 
 
Before you can proceed, you need to adjust so me of the access permissions on the files you 
have just uploaded.  When we start to configure phpBB, the installation pro gram will need 
permission to create its config file on our web server.  To allow this to happen, we need to 
change the access permissions of the config file so that every user on the server, including the phpBB program, can write to that file.   
 
In theory, this means that other people whose web sites are host ed on the same server could 
also access your config file.  In practice , however, almost all web hosting companies 
configure their servers in such a way as to lock each customer to within the confines of their 
own area, so there’s nothing to worry about.  Bu t if you’re particularly concerned, check with 
your hosting company. 
 
To change the permissions of the config file, scroll down the list of uploaded files in the

Do the same thing with the cache and files fold ers.  IE, change their permissions to 777. 
 
Finally, double-click the images folder to open it.  Then, within it, open the avatars folder.  Within there, right-click the upload folder  and change its permissions, too, to 777. 
 That’s the file permissions change d.  You can now exit FileZilla. 
 
Now we need to run the phpbb installer on the web server.  We’ve already uploaded the 
program files, so open a web browser and surf to  the install folder within your phpbb folder.  
In this example, where we uploaded the files to  www.the-web-book.com  in the phpbb 
folder, this means www.the-web-book.com/phpbb/install  and it brings up the 
following screen:

Something is clearly not right.  There are some PHP error messages at the top of the screen.  
However, these are actually notices rather than actual errors.  A notice is more friendly advice than a warning of a major problem.  Alth ough it could signify an error in the program, 
most notices happen because the configuration of the server isn’t precisely what the program was expecting.  In many cases, you don’t get to  see notices because the server is configured 
not to display them.  But clearly this one is happy to show them. 
 
We’ll persevere for now. This is only an installer. If the phpBB program appears to install and function correctly, we can stop worrying. Ob viously, if those same notices are shown to 
the users of our forum then this will be unacce ptable, and we’ll need to try some different 
software instead, rather than phpBB.  
Click on Start Install, and enter the informatio n that’s requested.  For the database type, 
choose MySQL.  The database server should be  specified as localhost unless your hosting 
company tells you otherwise.  Leave the database  server port blank, unless you specifically 
know that it needs to be set. 
 For the database name, enter the name of the MySQL database that you created as per the 
instructions on page 124. This is thewebbo_cms in our example.  The database username

 You need to select a database table prefix which is not used by any other programs that are 
configured to use this MySQL database.  The installer suggests phpbb_, which is fine, but 
you can change it if you want.

Before you can start using your forum, we need to  tidy up a few things.  First, remove the zip 
file and the extracted files from your PC as these are no longer required.  All that matters are 
the files on the web server.

Next, open FileZilla and connect to the server.  Go to the public_html folder, then the phpbb 
folder, and find the config.php file.  Now that the installer ha s done its job, and created the 
config file, we need to change its permissions ag ain so that no one can change it.  Right-click 
config.php, choose File Permissions, and change  the 3 sets of permi ssions to read/write, 
read, and read.  The numeric value should  say 644.  When it does, press OK. 
 
Just one more task.  Right-click the install fo lder and choose Delete. If you don’t do this, 
someone else could run the installer agai n, and wipe out all of your settings. 
 
When FileZilla has finished deleting the folder and its contents, close the program and return 
to your web browser.  Surf to your forum, which will be in the phpbb folder on your site.  In 
our case that means www.the-web-book.com/phpbb  and the screen will look like this:

You’re now all ready to start creating forums  and customising your phpBB system.  To get 
started, click the Forums tab and explore.  Remember, however, that the web is full of people 
who get their kicks from finding poorly-protected  forums that they can vandalise or fill with 
spam.  So ensure that you set the security options accordingly.  This means, at the very least, forcing people to sign up and log in before th ey can post messages, and verifying their signup 
by asking them to reply to an email message.   
 
You may also want to consider, at least in the early stages, configuring the forums so that new members can’t post until their account inform ation has been verified by you.  This will 
add to your workload in administering the syste m, but does help to ensure that spammers 
don’t attempt to sign up with multiple accounts that are merely used to flood your forums with advertising.

Plogger 
 
So far, the products we’ve installed on our web server are primarily text-based.  These 
include a Content Management System, a blog, and a forum.  Plogger is an image gallery a p p l i c a t i o n ,  a l l o w i n g  y o u  t o  u p l o a d  p i c t u r e s  t o  y o u r  s e r v e r  a n d  c r e a t e  o n l i n e  a l b u m s  f o r  
people to browse. However, it still requires a My SQL database, as it uses this to store details 
of images and some information about them.  It  doesn’t actually store the uploaded pictures 
in the database, though – these are uploaded to a folder on the server within the main Plogger directory. 
  Web servers aren’t generally good at handling image files.  Programs such as Plogger often 
boast the ability to manipulate pictures, such  as resizing them for display, generating 
thumbnails for browsing, and compressing them to  save space.  However, such functionality 
generally relies on the availabili ty of specific features that ar e not always available on all web 
servers.  Such features include the ImageMagick graphics library.  In the absence of such features, certain parts of the program may not work  properly, or at all.  You should therefore 
take special care to read the list of server requirements before deciding whether to install an 
image-based product such as Plo gger on your web site.  If you have problems with a specific 
product, there are always plenty of others to choose from.  
Getting Started 
 
To obtain the Plogger software, go to www.plogger.org  and click on the Download Plogger 
link to get the zip file. Right-click the downlo aded file, and choose Extract All to unzip it. 
 
Next, connect to your server with FileZilla.  Double-click the public_html folder to open it 
and then, within it, create a new folder called pl ogger (it’s best to stick with lower case letters 
rather than creating Plogger).

On the left hand side of the screen, in the Local Site window, browse to your desktop or 
wherever you extracted the zip file to.  Then double-click the Plogger folder to open it (you 
don’t need the MACOSX one).  
Select every file and folder in the left hand window except the ".." folder, and then press 
Return to begin uploading the Plogger system to  the web server.  FileZilla should look like 
this:

When the upload has finished, you can close FileZilla and also delete the extracted zip file 
from your PC.   
Next, make sure that you have created the te st MySQL database on your server, which we 
have been using for all of our product installa tions.  If you haven’t done so, refer to the 
procedure on page 124. 
The Installation Process 
 
With the Plogger system upload ed to your server, you can no w  s u r f  t o  i t  a n d  b e g i n  t h e  
configuration.  Open a web browser and go to  the _install.php page within your Plogger 
system.  In the case of our exam ple site, that means going to: 
 
www.the-web-book.com/plogger/_install.php 
 
You should see a screen like this:

Fill in the connection details for the MySQL databa se, so that Plogger can access it.  The host 
should be set to localhost unless your hosting company has advised you otherwise.  The 
username and password will normally be the same  as you use for logging into your site's 
hosting control panel.   In our examples the database name is thewebbo_cms.  When you’ve finished, click the Install button an d Plogger will finish its setup process.  Once 
it has done so, it will create an admin account for you, so that you’ll be able to log in and 
upload pictures.  The admin password is rand omly generated and will be displayed on the 
screen, so make sure you don’t close your brow ser until you’ve made a note of your admin 
username and password!  
The screen should look like this, assuming th e installation and configuration succeeded:

When you’ve made a note of your admin user name and password, click the Proceed button.  
Plogger will then tell you the URLs for browsi ng your gallery and for logging in as an 
administrator.  These are, in the case of our example site: 
 
www.the-web-book.com/plogger   for public access 
www.the-web-book.com/plogger/admin   for the admin login screen 
 
You may find you also see a few error warning notices displayed at this point.  If this 
happens, check that you can browse and administ er the site correctly.  Assuming you can, 
there’s nothing to worry about.  If the problems persist, chec k your hosting company’s online 
FAQ or support section to see if there’s any reason why these error message might be displayed.  Also (and this is a good tip for any similar situation), try typing or pasting the full 
text or the error message into a search engine such as Google, to find out if anyone else has reported similar problems.  Hopefully they’ll also have reported how they solved them. 
Uploading Your Pictures 
 
With Plogger now installed on your web server, you’ll need to upload a picture in order to 
test that it’s working properly.  Surf to the ad min page, as listed above, and enter your admin 
username and password when prompted.  You ma y also wish to try entering an incorrect

password, just to make sure that the security is working properly.  Performing such a test 
each time you install any new product on your server is always a good idea. 
 Once you’re logged in, you’ll see this screen: 
 
 
 
 
Click the Browse button and navigate to an image file on your computer.  Add a caption and 
a description (this is important, as you’ll se e later).  Then choose which album you want to 
add your picture to. You’ll probably want to create  a new one rather than putting it in the test 
collection.  
When everything’s ready, click the Upload button and wait for the message that says your upload was successful. 
 
When it’s done, log out and surf to the public part of your site rather th an the admin section.  
You should see your gallery disp layed.  To check that Plogger is correctly storing information 
in your MySQL database, use the search box.  Just type a word or two from the caption or 
description, and check that Plogger finds your picture.

With everything working properly, you can now pr oceed to make your site look as you want 
it to.  Log into the admin section again and ex plore the various features that are available. 
Avoiding Data Overload 
 
When you sign up for a web hosting package, your account comes with a certain amount of 
disk space on the server to store your information.  If you’re storing mostly text, you don’t 
need to worry about hitting your limit.  But if you intend to store lots (as in, thousands) of 
pictures, be aware that they eat server space li ke nothing else.  Especially if they are high-
resolution multi-megapixel im ages, which can typically occupy up 10 MB each.   
 If you think this might be a problem for you,  check the small print of your web hosting 
package to find out just how much server space you get.  Remember, too, that people who 
view or download your pictures  will use up your bandwidth al location, so you may want to 
check that as well.  For example, if you have a 10 MB picture on your site and 100 people 
download it, that’s 1 GB of band width traffic from your server. 
 
Equally, if you upload 100 pictures to your gallery, at 10 MB each, that’s 1 GB of traffic from 
your own broadband connection.  Which, if you are paying for a broadband service that only 
allows you 2 GB a month, is a fairly large chunk.  If this is the case, check whether your ISP

Installing the PSPad Editor 
 
While Amaya is great for editing HTML files, it’s  not so good if you’re writing JavaScript or 
PHP.  The solution comes in the form of an excellent program called PSPad.  It’s a text editor 
with two features that make it ideal for writing programs.  First, it understands the syntax of JavaScript and PHP, so it can alert you if you make a mistake.  Second, it has a built-in FTP 
facility, thus making it easy to upload your prog rams to the web server if you need to do so.  
And like everything else we’ve used throughout this book, it’s downloadable free of charge.   
The following chapters cover how to write progra ms in JavaScript and PHP so, if you intend 
to follow them, you need to install PSPad now. 
 
To obtain the program, visit www.PSPad.com  and download the full installer.  This will copy 
a small (only 4 MB or so) .EXE file to your computer. Double-click th at file to begin the 
installation, accepting all of th e default options (though you’ll p r o b a b l y  w a n t  t o  r e j e c t  t h e  
offer of additional language su pport unless you really do want to have the option of seeing 
the PSPad menus in Indonesian and other non-English tongues).  With the program 
installed, you should now see a PSPad icon on your desktop. 
 
Double-click the PSPad icon to start the progra m, if it’s not already started automatically 
after being installed.  You’ll see th e main screen, which looks like this:

We now need to configure the program before we  can use it.  Mainly, this means setting up 
the FTP details so that PSPad knows how to copy files from our PC to the web server.   First, 
though, you can turn off that confusing menu of  assorted icons at the top of the screen, as 
you don’t need them.  To do this, just press the F2 key. 
 Now to configure the FTP site of things.  Click th e FTP tab on the left hand side of the screen, 
to get to PSPad’s FTP facility: 
 
 
 
Then click the connection icon:

A dialogue box will appear, into which you can enter the details of your FTP connection to 
the server.  This is very similar to the process that we went through right at the start of this 
book, for configuring FileZilla.

For the Connection Name, just choose a name for this connection.  This is purely for your 
benefit so that, if you configure PSPad to co nnect to multiple servers, you can choose one 
from a list.  I’ll call mine The Web Book.   
 
Following the server-specific examples as per the earlier examples in this book, for the site at 
the-web-book.com which is hosted by hostmonster, the required details are the-web-book.com for the server, thewebbo for the username, and the password that I normally use 
for connecting to my web hosting space. 
 
Enter just a / symbol for the remote directory.  Leave everything else as it is, and press the 
OK button to finish.  You’ll return to a list of options that shows your list of available 
connections (just the one so far, namely the one you just created) and some buttons.  Click 
the top button, labelled Connect, to connect to your web server.  Assuming it works, you 
should see something like this, with the contents of your serv er listed down the left hand 
side.

Javascript 
 
HTML is a very full-featured language.  When coupled with CSS, it’s capable of producing just about every design of web page you coul d  e v e r  d e s i r e .   B u t  H T M L  i s  o n l y  a  m a r k u p  
language, for specifying how pages should look.  Wh ich is just fine if you intend your web site 
to act as an electronic version of a newspape r, magazine, book or brochure.  But sometimes 
you'll want to create web sites that exploit the power of computers, including features that go 
above and beyond the capabilities of electronic publishing.  For example animation, online databases, and so on.  
To add such features to our sites, we need to leave the safe environment of HTML markup 
and enter the world of web-based programming.  Once you know how to write programs, just 
about anything becomes possible. 
 
The following chapters explain the basics of web programming using Javascript and PHP.  
I'll show you how to create basic web applic ations (often known as Web 2.0 sites) using 
Javascript and PHP.  But be aware that this is a complex subject which takes a couple of years to master, and this is best done by practi sing rather than reading.   So now might be a 
good time to think of a Web 2.0 application that  you’ve always wanted to write, in order that 
you can apply what you’re about to  read to a real situation.   
Choose Your Side 
 
There are two ways to write web-based programs, and understanding the difference between 
them is vital because each method is used for specific purposes.  As a reminder, the following explanations use the term "visitor" to describe  a person who visits your web site, ie who 
views it online by using a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox.  The first programming method is called clie nt-side programming.  This means writing 
programs that will run on the visitor’s computer, within thei r web browser. Just about all 
modern web browsers support this, via a progra mming language called JavaScript.  To write 
a JavaScript program, you include it within the body of a web page along with the HTML 
code.  Note that JavaScript is not the same as Ja va, and you should never refer to it as such.   
 The second programming method is called server-side programming.  Here, you write 
programs that run on the web server.  The brow ser never gets to see the program code.  It 
merely sees the results, which normally consist of HTML code that is sent to it.  The fact that this code was generated by a program running on  the server, rather than being stored in a 
pre-written .html file, is unknown to the browser.  The most common languages for writing server-side programs are PHP, Perl, Python , Ruby and Java, as well as Microsoft’s 
proprietary languages ASP and ASP.NET.

So how do you decide which type of program you need to write?  Should it be client-side or 
s e r v e r - s i d e ?   I t  d e p e n d s  e n t i r e l y  o n  w h a t  y o u  w a n t  t o  a c h i e v e ,  a n d  t h i s  s h o u l d  b e c o m e  clearer as you read the chapters that follow.  It also means that , to develop full-featured sites, 
it helps to know a little about both types.  In the next chapter, we’ll co ver server-side programming usin g PHP.  For the remainder of 
this chapter, we’ll cover client -side JavaScript programming.  First, though, if you haven’t 
already done so, follow the instructions on page 162 and install PSPad on your PC.  
 
Start PSPad and connect to your server, so that the list of files and folders appears down the 
left hand side of the screen.  The list should look familiar from when  you used FileZilla.  
These are the contents of your web server, br ought to you via the FTP component in PSPad. 
 
Double-click the public_html folder to go to the place on the server where your web-
accessible files are stored.  If you previously installed products such as joomla, wordpress, 
phpbb and plogger, you’ll see their folders here. 
 We’re going to create a new file with which we can start exploring JavaScript.  So right-click 
on the top folder icon (the one that just co nsists of 2 dots) and choose New File.  Enter 
jstest.html as the new of your new file and pre ss OK.  Verify that PSPad has created the file 
on your server, which should appe ar at the bottom of the list. 
 Now let’s create a very simple web page in that file.  Double-click jstest.html to open it, and 
verify that the blue title bar of your PSPad wi ndow changes from new1.t xt to jstest.html.  
This tells you that the correct file  is open, and ready for editing. 
 Into your new jstest.html file, type the following: 
 
<HTML> 
<body> 
This is a JavaScript test 
</body> 
</HTML> 
 
When you’re done, go to the File menu and click Close.  Click Yes to confirm.  The PSPad program has now created your jstest.html file directly on the web server.   
 This is a different way of working, compared wi th how we did things previously.  There’s no 
need to upload our test page with FileZilla as it ’s already there.  There’s no local copy in our 
Web Work folder.

Let’s make sure it worked.  Quit PSPad and open  your web browser.  Surf to your site and 
page.  In this case it’s www.the-web-book.com/jstest.html , which brings up the 
following: 
 
 
 
So far so good.  But that’s plain HTML rather than JavaScript, and nothing we haven’t seen 
before. So let’s remedy that.  
Fire up PSPad again.  Connect to the server by clicking the FTP tab, and then the first icon in 
the row beneath it.  Go into your public_html fold er then double-click your jstest.html file to 
open it. 
 
Now, before the </body>  tag, add the following: 
 
<script type="text/javascript"> 
alert("Hello There"); </script> 
 
When you’re done, save the file to the server (F ile, Save should do it, as PSPad has its handy 
built-in FTP program).  Then quit PSPad, open your browser, and surf to your jstest page 
again.  You should see the following:

In addition to the text on th e page, there’s now an alert box with a message in it.  Not 
something that HTML can do on its own, but our little JavaScript program enables us to do 
clever things like this. 
 Our 3 lines of JavaScript aren't particularly cl ever. You should be able to decipher how it 
works without too much trouble.  The li ne which does all the hard work is: 
 
alert ("Hello There"); 
 
The "alert" command is the one which creates the alert box.  
As I mentioned earlier, JavaScript code co-exi sts with HTML code in the same .html file.  
The <script type="text/javascript">  tag tells the Web browser that you’re 
switching from HTML into Javascript, and the  </script>  tag then switches back into 
HTML again.  Note that these tags don’t require semi-colons as they themselves are HTML 
tags rather than JavaScript commands.  
As already discussed, JavaScript is a client-side language rather than server-side.  I’ll repeat 
this again, as understanding the difference is vitally important.  The most vitally important point to note is that, because the JavaScript code  goes in the HTML file, it’s visible to anyone 
who uses the View Source option.  If you surf  to your jstest.html page again and choose the

View, Source option in your we b browser, you’ll see what this means.  The screen will look 
like this: 
 
 
 Although JavaScript is very useful, and great fun, the fact that anyone can view your JS code in the browser means one important thing: ne ver use JavaScript for anything related to 
security or authentication on your site.  Fo r example, it’s perfectly possible to create a 
password system in JavaScript whereby the visitor is asked to enter a password and is only shown the "secret" page if he enters it correctly .  But if you implement th is in JavaScript, it’s 
trivial for a hacker to look at your sour ce code, find the bit which effectively says "if 
password = ‘sesame’ then let him in" , and thus deduce the password. 
 
The way round this conundrum is to use a pr ogramming method whereby the code for the 
program doesn’t appear in the page.  That’s what server-side programming with languages

 Let’s example this in a little more detail, and yo u’ll hopefully realise th at Javascript isn’t as

Lines 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 should be familiar to you.  This is standard HTML code, as explained 
in the previous chapters.  This includes the "the  current time is:" message, which, as you can 
see from the screen picture, gets displayed on th e finished web page just as you’d expect it to. 
 Line 4 tells the browser that we’re now in JavaScript mode, and that everything which follows comprises a JavaScript program rather than normal HTML.  Up until line 11, which 
ends the program and tells the web browser th at we’re back with standard HTML again. 
 
Incidentally, you can include as many JS script s in an HTML file as you wish.  Just use a 
<script> tag at the start of each one, and end with </script>.     
 Now let’s look at how the JS code works.  Line 5 creates a new variable called d, which is set 
to the current date and time.  That’s what the date() function in JS does – it returns the 
current date and time.  
You’ll remember that, at the star t of this chapter, I pointed out that JavaScript is a client-side 
programming language.  That is, it runs on the web client (the visitor’ s browser) rather than 
the web server.  By using the date() function, this becomes evident and significant, because the date and time which get returned are thos e of the visitor’s computer, wherever that 
happens to be.  If it’s 7pm on the user’s co mputer, the page will display the hour as 19. 
 Contrast this with what would happen if we ha d retrieved the time from the server.  7pm in 
the UK is 2pm in New York.  So if the server is in New York and a UK-based visitor checked 
the page at 7pm, he’d be told that the time is 2pm.  Server-side programming has its uses, as 
we’ll see later, but retrieving th e date and time isn’t necessarily one of them.  At least, not if 
you intend to display it for the visitor. 
 
Line 6 introduces the document.write statement.  Here’s yet another fundamental concept 
that you need to understand if you’re getting into web programming.   This statement inserts content into the web page, just as if you’d writ ten it yourself.  But in  this case, we’re not 
inserting literal text that we know in adva nce.  Instead, we’re inserting the "hours" 
component of variable d.    
The remaining lines, which insert the minutes and seconds, as well as a couple of full stops, 
should be self-evident. 
 
A t  t h i s  p o i n t ,  i t ’ s  v i t a l  t h a t  y o u  u n d e r s t a n d  h o w  d o c u m e n t . w r i t e  w o r k s .   S o  t a k e  a  l o o k  a t

<script type="text/javascript"> 
document.write ("Hello") 
</script> </body> 
</HTML> 
 
<HTML> 
<body> 
Hello </body> 
</HTML> 
 
Before we leave this example program, there’s one slight problem that we need to fix.  The 
minutes and the seconds don’t look right, beca use there’s a zero missing from the front of 
each of them.  Which is just as we’d expect if, for example, the current time is 8 minutes past 
the hour.  The date() function is doing what it’s  supposed to do, and returning a value of 8 for 
the minutes.  If we want to display it in a cosmetically-enhanced way, it’s up to us to add the necessary code.    
So, edit the jstest.html file and add the following after line 7: 
 
if (d.getMinutes() < 10 ) 
{ 
document.write("0") } 
 
And add the following after what’s shown above as line 9:  
if (d.getSeconds() < 10 ) 
{ document.write("0") 
} 
 
The purpose of this code should be obvious.   Before we display the minutes, we check 
whether the value is less than 10 and, if so, insert a zero into the document (ie, the web 
page).  Ditto for the seconds.  
This also shows you how to use the "if…" statement in JavaScript.  Specifically, note the way 
that everything which should be executed if the statement is true, goes in curly brackets.    
The ability to perform date-based calculations in  web pages is very handy.  For example, you 
could easily write a web page which automatica lly alters its appearance according to the

season.  Just create 4 images that correspond to spring, summer, autumn and winter.  Then 
use some Javascript to find out the curr ent month and perform one of 4 different <img 
src=xyz.jpg>  operations, where xyz corresponds to the name of one of your image files.  
Alternatively, you could automatically add a "Me rry Christmas" footer to your home page if 
the month is December and the date is the 25th. 
Javascript and Semicolons 
 
A word is in order about Javascript and semicolo ns.  You'll have noticed in the examples that 
some lines end with a semicolon while others do n ' t .   I n  J a v a s c r i p t ,  e a c h  l i n e  o f  c o d e  i s  
considered to end either at the end of the line  o r  a t  t h e  s e m i c o l o n .   S o  i f  y o u  w r i t e  e a c h  
statement on a single line, you don't need a se micolon.  But if you're including multiple 
statements on a single line, they need to be separated with a semicolon. For example, these are all valid (I've coloured the semicolons for clarity): 
 
document.write ("Hello") 
document.write ("Hello") ; 
document.write ("Hello") ; document.write ("Hello again") 
document.write ("Hello") ; document.write ("Hello again") ; 
 
But these are not: 
 
document.write ("Hello") document.write ("Hello again") ; 
document.write ("Hello") document.write ("Hello again") 
Email Address Obfuscation 
 
Those who send spam email for a living need to find a constant source of new email 
addresses to which they can send their annoying, offensive advertisements.  They do this in 
various ways, one of which is to scour the inte rnet looking for web pages that contain email 
a d d r e s s e s .   I t ' s  a c t u a l l y  n o t  d i f f i c u l t  t o  d o .   A l l  t h a t ' s  r e q u i r e d  i s  a  p r o g r a m  t o  r a n d o m l y  
connect to millions of web pages and scan the co ntent for an "@" symbol.  Then look for the 
nearest space to the left, and space to the right.  Everything between those two spaces is 
likely to be an email address, ready to add to the spammer's mailing list. 
 
Because of this, one of the best ways to ensure that your email address remains relatively free 
from spam is to never mention it on a web page .  However, you probably also want people to 
be able to contact you by email.  Thankfully , Javascript provides a great solution to the 
problem.

Instead of including your email addr ess literally on the page, such as r, write a small 
Javascript program which uses one or more document.write() statements.  For example, 
whenever you want to quote your email address, use the following on the page instead: 
 
<script language="javascript"> 
document.write("robert"); document.write("@"); 
document.write("the-web-book.c"); 
document.write("om"); 
</script> 
 
Such behaviour is enough to confuse the vast majority of the so-called automatic email address harvester programs that are continually scanning the web in search of fresh 
addresses. 
 I f  y o u  w a n t  s o m e t h i n g  e v e n  s m a r t e r ,  s e a r c h  o n line with your favourite search engine for 
"javascript email address obfuscation".  This will lead you to a variety of web sites which 
allow you to enter an email address and which will then generate a complex impenetrable Javascript program just for you which, when ru n by a visitor's web browser, will show your 
email address. 
Why Upload? 
 You may be wondering why, if JavaScript is a client-side language that gets executed by the 
browser, we have to upload pages to the server before we can test them.  Can you not just 
double-click on jstest.html from within Wind ows and get the browser to execute the local 
copy instead, and save yourself the hassle of uploading the file until it’s ready for public 
consumption?  In theory, yes you can.  You don’t need to trouble your web server at all when you’re 
developing JS pages.  However, in practice, many web browsers don’t like letting you do this.  
They regard it as a security risk, on the basi s that any JS code in a local page must be 
malicious.  Internet Explorer versions 7 and 8, for example, will pop up various warnings 
asking if you really want to allow this code to run.  The only way to stop this is to reduce the 
security settings on your browse r, which is not wise as it will also reduce your safety on the 
web in general. 
 
Therefore, it’s best to always run JavaScript code off a server.  But it’s important to realise that this is not because it’s a requirement of the language.

Security and Cookies 
 
Having a fully-functional programming language built into a web browser would be a serious 
security risk.  Being able to find out the time on someone’s PC is perfectly safe, but what if a 
malicious web site tried to read the user’s private files instead, or write a virus to the 
computer?  Thankfully, this is impossible, beca use JS is designed with security in mind.  
Most fundamentally, there are no facilities in the language that allows the programmer, and 
thus a malicious web site, to access any of the files on the visitor’s computer.  
 
Actually, there’s one exception.  Let me tell you about cookies. 
 
A cookie is a small text file which a web site ca n write to the hard disk of any computer that 
visits the site, and then retrieve at a later date.  It’s part of the HTML specification, rather 
than anything to do with JavaScript particular ly.  But it needs a programming language such 
as JavaScript or PHP in order to operate.  Cookies are rather like pieces of electronic graffiti.  They can contain any data which the web 
site operator wishes to store, but are limited to  around 1000 characters each.  A site can store 
more than one cookie on a visitor’s computer.  Crucially, for security purposes, the only site 
which can read a cookie is the site th at put it there in the first place. 
 
So what are cookies used for?  Imagine a publ ic web site where you’re browsing a library 
catalogue in search of that excellent volume, " Defeating The Hacker " by Robert Schifreen.  A 
couple of days later, you visit the site again and, as if by magic, you find yourself on the page 
about Defeating The Hacker.  How did the web site  know?  Because last time you visited, the 
site stored a small cookie on your computer ca lled "last-book-visited", the value of which was 
set to "defeating the hacker".  Or, more likely, the value was set to the database record ID or 
the ISBN of the book, but that’s not important right now.  All you need to know is that each 
cookie has a name (in this case, last-book-visited) and a value (in this case, defeating the 
hacker). 
 Creating and reading a cookie isn’t particularly difficult.  There are commands built into 
JavaScript to do it, and it only takes a few line s of code.  A Google search for "javascript set 
cookie" or "javascript read cook ie" will show you some examples. 
 
Unfortunately, reading cookies in  J S  i s  s l i g h t l y  m o r e  d i f f i c u l t  t h a n  s e t t i n g  t h e m .   T h a t ’ s  
because there’s no specific command in JavaScript that says "give me the value of the last-
book-browsed cookie". Instead, there’s only a command which says "give me a list of all my 
c o o k i e  n a m e s  a n d  v a l u e s " .   O n c e  y o u  h a v e  t h i s  l i s t ,  y o u  t h e n  h a v e  t o  s e a r c h  t h r o u g h  i t  i n  
search of the cookie you want.  B u t ,  a s  w i t h  e v e r y t h i n g  w e b - r e l a t e d ,  a  G o o g l e  s e a r c h  w i l l

bring you some ready-made JS code for searching for a specific cookie among the haystack of 
data. 
 One other thing worth knowing about cookies is that each one has an expiry date/time which 
is set when the cookie is created.  When a cook ie expires, it gets deleted from the computer.  
Any attempt to subsequent ly read its value will result in the return of nothing at all. 
 
Expiry dates can be:  a) a specific date and time, eg May 4
th 2011; b) a duration, eg 31 days 
from now; or c) as soon as the user closes his or her browser. If you don’t specify an expiry 
date when creating a cookie , option C is the default. 
 Cookies are a very useful feature, which most web developers use on their sites.  It allows you 
to store information about particular visitors, without forcing them to create an account on 
your site and log in. But there’s one golden ru le about cookies, which you need to know if 
you’re going to consider using them.  Although the only web site that can read a cookie is the one which created it, any user of a PC who has administrator privileges can read and alter 
any cookie on his computer.  That’s because a c ookie is nothing more than a small data file, 
albeit one with a strange name and often stored in a hard-to-find location on the hard disk.  
But it’s a file nonetheless, and it can be access ed just like any other.  This state of affairs 
allows for something called "cookie poisonin g", which is where the user of a computer 
deliberately changes the value of a cookie. 
 
Let’s re-examine the earlier example, where a cookie called last-book-browsed is set to 
"defeating the hacker, by robert schifreen".  With the necessary software on his computer, a visitor to the library site could change the valu e of the cookie to "defeating the afanc, by 
Rohan Stevenson".  Having done so, next time he  visits the library site  he’ll be taken to the 
page for that MP3 track, ra ther than the hacker book. 
 
Does this matter?  No, not in the slightest.  But it neatly illustrates the golden rule about 
client-side web programming with  JavaScript and HTML. Let’s consider another example, to 
see why. 
 
The library web site asks users to create an account and log in, if they wish to purchase 
books.  The mechanism that they deploy in order to handle the authentication, ie the logging 
in, is as follows: 
 
1. Ask the user for their username and password 
2. If these details are correct, set a cookie on the user’s computer called "is_logged_in" with a value of "YES". 
3. Each time the user wishes to access a protected page, check the value of the 
is_logged_in cookie and only proceed if its value is YES.

A lot of web sites actually use a technique like this.  But hopefully you can see the flaw.  If a 
visitor poisons the is_logged_in cookie on his PC and changes the value from NO to YES, he 
can bypass all of the site security. 
 
So, by all means use cookies for convenience. But don’t use them for anything security-
related, or for things where you need to be confident that the value of the cookie hasn’t been changed without your knowledge. For such th ings as that, you need to use server-side 
programming instead, which is coming up later. 
Morning All! 
 Here’s another example Javascript  program. To use it, copy and paste it into your jstest.html 
file in place of what’s there already, using PSPad.  But before you do, read through the code and see if you can work out what it does.  
<HTML> 
<body> Good 
<script type="text/javascript"> 
var d = new Date() 
var time = d.getHours() 
if (time < 12)  
{ document.write(" morning ") 
} 
if (time >= 12)  { 
document.write(" day ") 
} </script> 
everyone! 
</body> </HTML> 
 
The program displays a message, which is made up three words.  The first word, part of the 
standard HTML component of the file, is "Good ".  The final word, in the same fashion, is 
" e v e r y o n e ! " .   I n  b e t w e e n ,  t h e  s e c o n d  w o r d  i s  g e n e r a t e d  b y  s o m e  J a v a S c r i p t  a n d  i s  e i t h e r  
"day" or "morning", depending on whether the time  on the visitor’s PC is before or after mid-
day.  This is a simple technique, and one th at you might want to use on your own pages.

Getting the Screen Size 
 
Before we finish our brief foray into Javascri pt, here’s one more example.  It shows yet 
another reason why client-side programming, and being able to interroga te various features 
of the visitor’s PC and browser, is so useful. 
 
<HTML> 
<body> 
<script language="javascript"> 
var w = screen.width; 
var h = screen.height; 
if ((w=1024) and (h=768)) 
{ document.write("<img src=normal-pic.jpg>"); 
} 
if ((w > 1280) and (h > 1024)) { 
document.write("<img src=bigger-pic.jpg>"); 
} </script> 
</body> 
</HTML> 
 
This is the code for a simple web page whic h contains nothing more than a picture. The 
clever part, though, is the JavaScript code which looks up the screen width and height of the 
visitor’s computer and then uses document.w rite to create HTML code on-the-fly.   
Specifically, it generates one of two different <img> tags.  If the screen resolution is 1024 by 768, the normal-pic.jpg image gets loaded.  But if the resolution is hi gher, the bigger-pic.jpg 
file is displayed instead.  
Javascript Toolkits and Frameworks 
 If the idea of writing client -side code appeals, but you don’t want to learn a whole new 
language, consider using a ready-made toolkit or framework.  There are a number of such products around, that contain a large collection of ready-made Javascript  effects that you can 
call upon within your web pages.  One of the most popular is jQuery, which you can find at 
www.jquery.com .  And the best news is that it’s available completely free of charge. 
 
The jQuery framework is simple to use.  Just copy the single jquery.js file to your web server, 
then use a couple of lines of code in the <head>  section of your HTML page to load it.  From 
then on, each effect that you want to achieve on your web page is typically just a handful of

$("div.contentToChange p.firstparagraph:hidden").slideDown("slow"); 
$("div.contentToChange p.firstparagraph:visible").slideUp("slow"); 
 
There are lots more examples and tutorials on the jQuery web site, and it’s definitely worth 
taking a look if you want to include visual effects on your web pages.  Incidentally, the above code makes reference to something called the DOM, or the Document 
Object Model, which is a way of referring to specific items on an HTML page.  It’s part of the 
HTML specification, rather than anything to do  with jQuery.  The DOM, and manipulating it 
with a technology called Ajax, isn’t currently included in this  book but may be added in the 
future.  Contact me via www.the-web-book.com  if you want it to be. 
Finding Out More 
 As you are hopefully discovering, JavaScript is a very useful tool for anyone developing web 
pages.  Sadly, though, not all of  the language is as easy to use as the previous chapter might 
have led you to believe.  A search in your lo cal library or on web sites such as Amazon will 
lead you to some excellent books on JavaScript, some of which run to 1000 pages or so.  It 
really is a very complex, full-featured language.  But if you don’t want to go to the trouble and 
expense of buying a book, a Google search for "javascript tutorial" will lead you to lots of useful online resources. 
 
Because JS is all client-side, you can also look at other people’s code t oo.  Just use the View 
Source option in your browser, when lookin g at any page which you think might be using 
JavaScript, then search for a <script>  t a g .   I n  f a c t ,  s e a r c h  f o r  <script  rather than 
<script> , because the "language=javascript part is actually optional (albeit bad practice) 
and this will find both cases. 
 
There is also a wealth of ready-made JavaScript programs available for download from various web sites, many of which are free to use.  One of my favourite sites is 
www.hotscripts.com , which has thousands of such  programs available.  The 
www.dynamicdrive.com  site is another useful resource, which also offers lots of Javascript 
code for free download. 
 
One of the most common uses for JavaScript is for navigation and menus.  You’ve probably seen web sites with all sorts of interesting menu  effects, such as drop -down menus that look 
like Windows applications, or menus that slide around the screen so that, no matter how you 
scroll the page, the menu is always in the middle. Almost all of these are done with

JavaScript, and sites like hotscripts will let yo u download the code to do it. Just follow the 
instructions that accompany the download, wh ich are normally no more complicated than 
"copy this block of JavaScript into your HTML file and change the relevant text to customise

Beware, though, of copying larg e chunks of code out of exis ting web pages unless you are

custom menu code written for its site won’t be t oo pleased if you start using it on yours too.  
Just because copying the code is technically possible doesn’t make it legal.

Web-hosted Databases with MySQL 
 
In the previous chapter we looked at client -side programming using Javascript, which runs 
in the user’s web browser.  In a later chapte r we’ll look at server-side programming with 
PHP.  However, one of the most useful features of PHP is its ability to talk to server-based databases, so we first need to understand such things.  
There are various server-based database products which store their information on a server 
rather than on the user’s local PC.  That server doesn’t necessarily have to be a web server – the main point is that the database is held ce ntrally and then accessed by multiple users, 
from multiple locations.  
In the world of databases, th e most popular language for interrogating a database is 
something called Structured Query Language, or SQL.  Many database products use SQL, or 
something like it.  Most SQL or SQL-like databa se server products cost serious money, such 
as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server.  One, though , is totally free of charge, and unsurprisingly 
this is the one that most web hosting companies install for your use.  The product is called 
MySQL (pronounced my ess queue ell, or someti mes my sequel).  Don’t be put off by the 
price tag – MySQL is corporate-strength software, just as happy storing tens of millions of 
items as a mere handful. 
 In this chapter I’ll show you ho w to manually connect to your web server via a browser and 
create a database.  In the next  chapter, you’ll see how to ac cess your database using PHP, 
which will finally allow you to create web-base d applications and database-driven web sites. 
 
You won’t be able to try any of the examples th at follow unless your web host offers MySQL.  
Almost all of them do, though some make a small additional charge to enable it.  In the case 
of the hosting company that we’re featuring th roughout this book, hostmonster.com, MySQL 
is included. 
 Remember that MySQL is a server-based product, installed on your web server rather than 
your local PC.  Equally, all of th e data in its databases is stored on the server too.  To access 
the system in order to create and browse databa ses, you use a web browser.  In the case of 
many hosting companies, and hostmonster is no  different, accessing MySQL requires you to 
access two different web sites.  One location is for creating the initial databases.  The other 
location is for managing those databases, which means: creating tables and fields; adding 
and deleting data; searching the database tables .  The reason for this demarcation is because 
of security considerations.

Databases, Tables, Fields, Rows and Columns 
 
At this point, you’re probably getting confused by the mention of  databases, tables, fields and 
so on.  So before we continue, let’s clear up the differences.  It’s vital that you understand 
some basic terminology in order to avoid conf usion later on.  Most importantly, what you 
probably think of as a database is actually referred to as a table.    A table is a collection of rows and columns.  Think of it just like a spreadsheet.  You might 
have a table called "contacts".  The columns are headed "name", "address" and 
"phone_number".  A row might consist of 3 fields (just like spreadsheet cells) containing the 
values "John Smith", "65 High Street, London", and "01234 567890". 
 
A database is a collection of tables.  Typically, those tables are all related but there’s no rule t h a t  s a y s  t h e y  h a v e  t o  b e .   F o r  e x a m p l e ,  l e t’s imagine that you’re  creating a database 
application for a system that manages the running of a hotel.  The data base itself might be 
called "hms" (for hotel management system).  Within the database might be 3 separate 
tables.  One, called "customers", contains the contact details of all past, present and future  
guests.  Another table, called "staff", might cont ain the contact and salary details for staff.  A 
final table, called "rooms", might contain de tails of the bedrooms, with column headings 
such as room_number, occupied_by, be d_type, phone_number, needs_cleaning, 
date_last_occupied and so on. 
 Many hosting companies limit the number of databases that you can create.  Typically, to 
between 1 and 5.  However, this is not a problem as you are rarely limited in the number of 
tables that you can create within each database.  Even if you only have one database, you can still create hundreds of tables in it.  Obviously,  being able to group your tables into related 
functions by using separate databases is handy, but it’s not essential.  If you only have the 
one database, and you want to create the ho tel management system, the standard way of 
doing such things is to add a prefix to each of the related tables in order to indicate that they 
are linked.  So we might choose an hms_ prefix for our hotel management system, and therefore name the tables hms_rooms, hms_gues ts, hms_staff and so on.  Other tables that 
are connected to other systems would have their own prefix. 
Normalization 
 While we’re discussing MySQL terminology, ther e’s one more thing that you need to know 
before we can start creating databases and tables  for real.  It’s nothing to do with MySQL or 
web sites specifically, but is more to do with basic computer science and the creation of any 
computer database.

The golden rule of database design is: "don’t st ore anything more than once.  Instead, store it 
just once, give it a unique reference number, and refer to it by that number  in future".  Why?  
Because it’s a much safer way to ensure that the database content remains accurate.  If you 
n e e d  t o  c h a n g e  s o m e t h i n g ,  y o u  o n l y  n e e d  t o  c h a n g e  i t  o n c e ,  a n d  a l l  r e f e r e n c e s  t o  i t  a r e  
automatically up to date.  Let me give you an example. 
 Consider our hotel management system.  There’s a table called "rooms", with columns called: 
 
room_number 
occupied_by 
bed_type 
phone_number needs_cleaning 
date_last_occupied 
 There’s also a "customers" table, with columns called: 
 
name address 
phone_number 
 Within the customers table is John Smith, and he’s currently resident in room 225.  How do 
we represent this in the database?  The obvious answer is to add him to the customers table 
and then create a new row in the "rooms" table, as follows:  
Room_number Occupied_by Bed_type Phone_number Needs_cleaning Date_last_occupied 
225 John Smith Single 7225 NO N/A 
 
However, this breaks our golden rule of only storing something once.  John Smith appears in 
both the "customers" table and the "rooms" table.  It’s a waste of space storing this 
information twice.  Also, if John Smith calls the hotel and says that we’ve spelled his name 
wrong on his bill (it should be Jon), we’d have to search every table looking for instances to 
change.    
There’s one further problem, too, which is even more serious.  What happens if a new guest, 
also called Jon Smith, checks into the hotel?  There are now 2 Jon Smiths in the customers 
table, but there’s no clue in the "rooms" table as  to which of them is currently in room 225.  
Which will play havoc with the billing system. 
 So here’s how we do it, according to the golden rule of giving everything a reference number 
and then referring to things by their number.  We create the customers table like this:

id 
name 
address phone_number 
 
The difference is that we’ve added a reference number column.  We’ve called it "id" rather than "reference number", simply because that’s the convention that most MySQL database 
designers use, but it’s not essential. 
 
So now, Jon Smith’s entry in the customers table might look like this: 
 
Id Name Address Phone_number 
64 Jon Smith 65 High Street, 
London 01234 567890 
 
And the reference to him in the "rooms" table looks like this: 
  
Room_number Occupied_by Bed_type Phone_number Needs_cleaning Date_last_occupied 
225 64 Single 7225 NO N/A 
 No longer is room 225 occupied by Jon Smith.  It’s now occupied by guest number 64.  And 
by checking the customers table and searching for the person whose id is 64, we know 
exactly which Jon Smith is in the room.  Furthe rmore, if Jon changes his name back to John, 
all we need to change is the single reference in the customers table.  All other references to 
him in the rooms table, the billing table, the re staurant bookings table, and so on, will only 
refer to him as customer 64 and not by name. 
 
So now you know why large co mpanies always want to know your customer reference 
number when you telephone them with an enquiry! 
 
Designing databases in this wa y, ie with information refere nced by a unique number, is 
known as normalization.  It’s often harder than it looks, but is well worth the effort invested.  
It ensures that your database, ie your collec tion of related tables, is working at peak 
efficiency.  As it happens, we've already missed a trick in the design of our hotel system.  You'll see that 
there's a date_last_occupied field in the rooms table.  But why do we need this?  Presuably, 
hotel bookings will be held in a "bookings" table which has columns called id, customer, 
arrival date, departure date and room number.  S o  i n  o r d e r  t o  f i n d  o u t  w h i c h  g u e s t  l a s t  
occupied a room, we don’t actually have to store any data at all.  We just search the bookings

ta bl e  inste ad.   I t' s this sort of pl a nning  tha t  takes just seconds to think about when you're 
designing a system, but days or weeks to implem ent if you discover, towards the end of the 
p r o j e c t ,  t h a t  y o u ' v e  b e e n  w o r k i n g  w i t h  a n  i n herent design flaw.  So, always give lengthy 
consideration to your database design before you start writing any programs. 
 
MySQL is known as a relational database.  Hopefully you can now see why.  Within the 
database is a collection of tables, and the inform ation in those tables is often related.  In the 
case of our rooms table, for example, there’s a relationship with the guests table.  We’ll return to this subject when we come to cr eate further database tables for our hotel 
management system in future chapters. 
 
Referential Integrity 
 
A normalised database, where each type of data item is held in a separate table with a unique 
id, makes a great deal of sense.  It's by far the most efficient way to store and manage 
information, whether you're designing a bookin g system for a 10-room hotel or an inventory 
manager for a web site the size of Amazon.  Howe ver, it's important to ensure that you don't 
end up with tables that refer to non-existing information.  In database terminology, this 
means making sure that you main tain the referential integrity. 
 
Consider the example above, where room 225 is currently occupied by guest number 64.  
Five years from now, you notice that Jon Smith has stopped visiting your hotel so you decide 
to remove him from the customer database.  Or  perhaps he calls the hotel and asks to be 
taken off the mailing list, and you do this by simply removing his entry from the customers 
table. 
 
As far as the customers table is concerned, there's no problem.  Where once was record 
number 64, now there's nothing.  But customer 64 is still referred to in the bookings table, and probably some other tables too.  Which is  going to cause problems.  For example, when 
you run the "show me everyone who's stayed in room 225 over the past 2 years" report, and the system tries to find out the name and address of the person whose customer id is 64, there will be nothing on file.  The integr ity of the relational database has failed. 
 It's important that you handle such instances,  a nd tha t you  ha ndle  the m correctly.   I n the 
case of the deleted customer, yo u can do one of three things: 
 
1. Delete the customer from the table.  In addition, also delete every affected row in every other table.  Which in this case would mean deleting all of customer 64's room 
bookings, restaurant reservations, customer comments, and whatever other tables 
have a customer_id reference. The problem here is that you lo se valuable data.

2. Replace the contents of customer's record with text such as "deleted".  Leave the id 
number in place, but change the firstname, surname, phone number, address etc.  Now, all your reports will still work corre c t l y  b u t ,  a s  p e r  M r  S m i t h ' s  w i s h e s ,  h i s  
information has been deleted from your system. 
 
3. Add a field to the customers ta ble called, say, is_live, whic h specifies whether this is a 
l i v e  c u s t o m e r  r e c o r d  o r  n o t .   K e e p  i t  s e t  to Y for all current customer records.  To 
delete a customer, you don't remove anything  from the customers ta ble.  Instead, you 
just set the customer's is_live flag from Y to N.  Now, in the code that produces your 
reports, you check whether a customer is live or not and, if not, you display "non-live 
customer" rather than the real data.  The old data is still there, but you simply choose not to display it.  Bear in mind, though, th a t  t h i s  c a n  s o m e t i m e s  f a l l  f o u l  o f  d a t a  
protection legislation in some countries, wh ich states that you should delete personal 
customer information if you no longer need it  or if the customer asks you to.  Merely 
marking it as non-live doesn't count as having deleted it. 
Creating A Database 
 Now that you understand the basics of relational database design, we can log onto the web server and actually create a database.  Throughout  the rest of this book, in the chapters that 
discuss MySQL and PHP, we’ll continue building and enhancing HMS, our Hotel 
Management System, as our exampl e database application.  If you have a different project in 
mind, feel free to adapt the examples as you go.  However, you will probably find it easier to 
start by following the examples as they appear .  Once you’re happy that the HMS system is 
working properly on your server, you can then adapt it into whatever you want.  
To create a MySQL database, you’ll need to fi nd out how this is done on the particular

As you can see, I currently have two database s created (thewebbo_cms and thewebbo_rs44).  
Hostmonster adds a prefix to its databases, ba sed on the username of the hosting account 
they belong to, hence thewebbo_ at the start of each database name.  The thewebbo_cms database is, if you have been reading this book from the start, the one we used in the earlier 
chapters when we installed Joomla, WordPress, phpBB and Plogger.  Using table prefixes, we installed all of the products into the same database. 
 
We need to create a new data base for our hotel management  system. We’ll call it hms for 
simplicity.  So, in the Create New Database se ction, type hms and click Create Database.  
You’ll see a confirmation message:

And that’s all there is to it.  But note that the database name is thewebbo_hms rather than 
plain hms, for reasons stated earlier.  You’ll n eed to know the name of  your database later, 
when we start to write PHP programs that access it.  
W i t h  t h e  d a t a b a s e  c r e a t e d ,  w e  h a v e  n o  f u r t h e r  n e e d  f o r  t h i s  p a r t  o f  t h e  c o n t r o l  p a n e l .   S o  
click the Home link at the bottom of the screen  to return to the main control panel screen 
and the full menu of da tabase-related things. 
 The third option says "phpMyAdmin".  This is a web-based progra m for managing MySQL 
databases on a remote server.  It’s a free, open source application that just about every web 
hosting company offers for use by customers (ie you, rather than the people who visit your 
web site).  It lets you create tables within databases, and it lets you create and manage the columns and rows within those tables.  The only thing that it can’t do (at least, not in a way 
that satisfies the security requir ements of most hosting companies) is to create the databases 
themselves, hence the previous step.   
 
From now on we’ll use phpMyAdmin to mana ge our new thewebbo_hms database and to 
create the tables in it.  Later on, we’ll write some PHP code which will use those tables to 
create a simple web-based hotel management application. 
 
You’ll be using phpMyAdmin extensively while yo u develop web sites, so it’s a good idea to 
grab its URL from the control panel and save it as a shortcut or favourite.  You’ll still need to 
enter your control panel username and password each time you access it, but at least you’ll be able to go straight to the program without firs t logging in to the control panel.  To do this, 
just surf to phpMyAdmin as normal and th en add the address to your web browser’s 
favourites.  Or copy the URL, and paste it into whatever web bookmark manager you prefer to use.  Or you could even save it as a shortcut on your desktop, for easy instant access.

Port Problems 
 
In theory, because phpMyAdmin is web-based, you should be able to reach it from any 
c o m p u t e r  t h a t  h a s  i n t e r n e t  a c c e s s .   H o w e v e r ,  i n  c o m m o n  w i t h  m a n y  o t h e r  h o s t i n g  
companies, hostmonster runs its installation s of phpMyAdmin on a non-standard port. 
 
Data travels across the internet using a syste m called TCP/IP, and information travels on 
different channels.  These are known as ports, and are rather like radio frequencies or TV channels.  Web traffic (ie, information that travels between web servers and the people who 
view the pages that are stored on them) generally uses port 80.  FTP uses ports 2o and 21.  
Email generally uses port 25, and so on. 
 
M o s t  f i r e w a l l s  a l w a y s  a l l o w  t r a f f i c  o n  t h e s e  " c o m m o n  p o r t s "  t o  f l o w  f r e e l y .   B u t  t h e y  a l s o  
often block traffic on uncommon ports.  So if your host runs phpMyAdmin on port 2083, for 
example, as Hostmonster does, then it’s possible that it will be blocked.  This doesn’t mean that any of your visitors will ever have proble ms accessing your web sites because they won’t 
be using phpMyAdmin at all (at least, you’d be t t e r  h o p e  n o t ! ) .   B u t  i t  d o e s  m e a n  t h a t ,  f o r  
example, if you want to manage your databases from the office, or an internet café, or your 
school or college, you might not be able to.  In  which case you’ll need to wait till you get 
home, unless you can persuade the person who manages your firewall to open the required 
port for you. 
Using phpMyAdmin 
 Click on your new shortcut, or go via the host  control panel if you wish, and you’ll see the 
phpMyAdmin home page which looks like this:

Depending on which version of phpMyAdmin yo ur hosting company runs, and the security 
permissions that it applies to your account, the screen may look slig htly different, but the 
basic structure wi ll be the same. 
 On the left hand side of the screen, in the bl ue panel, are your data bases.  In the example 
above, there are 4.  One is called information_schema, and the number in brackets tells you that it contains 21 tables.  There are also databases called thewebbo_cms, thewebbo_hms, a n d  t h e w e b b o _ r s 4 4 .   I n  t h i s  p a r t i c u l a r  c a s e ,  t h e  _ r s 4 4  o n e  i s  s o m e t h i n g  t h a t  I  h a v e  b e e n  
testing, so you can ignore it.  The _cms one is a remnant of our earlier experiments with 
Joomla, Plogger, phpBB and the like.  The _hms one is what we’re interested in right now, as 
this is what we’ll be using thro ughout the rest of this book as  we build our rudimentary hotel 
management system.  The information_schema database is part of the inner workings of MySQL on your hosting 
account.  Some hosts allow you to see it, whereas ot hers don’t.  If your host does, feel free to 
browse around it if you’re curiou s, but don’t change or delete an y of the information in it.  If 
you do, you face the serious risk of breaking your hosting account or at least your ability to use MySQL.

Creating The Customers Table 
 
The first stage in building our hotel management system is to create the "customers" table.  
Once we’ve done this, we’ll then use PHP to create a web site that allows hotel staff to create new customers and add them to the database.  We can then use those customers to create 
bookings, and slowly build up our system. 
 Although it’s possible to write PHP code which creates database tables  (assuming the hosting 
company doesn't specifically block you from do ing so), most web developers don’t bother.  
Creating the tables for your database is somethin g that you’ll only ever do once, so you might 
as well let phpMyAdmin do it for you.  If you make a mistake, or if you subsequently want to 
add new columns to the table (eg, you want to store a customer’s car registration number), 
phpMyAdmin allows that too.  
Fire up phpMyAdmin and get to the front screen , as shown above.  Click on the _hms entry 
in the left hand panel, to view the thewebbo_hms database.  There are currently no tables in 
the hms database so the scre en will look like this: 
 
 
 We’re interested in the "create new table on database thewebbo_hms" bit.  Type the name of the table (customers) into the bo x.  We’ll start with 7 fields, so enter that number into the 
box and click the Go button.  You’ll see the following:

You now have 7 lines (one for each field) into which you can enter the field name, its type, its 
length, and a few other things too. 
 
As you can see from the list of possible field type s that I’ve clicked on in the top field, there 
are lots to choose from.  It’s important that you choose the right field type for each field 
(column) in your table.  This generally means making two decisions.  First, whether or not 
the content of that field will be purely numeri c.  Because if it will be, choosing one of the 
numeric field types will result in a database  that can be searched and indexed more 
efficiently.  The second decision is for when you decide that the field won’t be purely n u m e r i c ,  b u t  w i l l  a l s o  h o l d  a l p h a b e t i c a l  t e x t .   I n  w h i c h  c a s e  y o u  n e e d  t o  s p e c i f y  t h e  maximum length of any one field.  I’ll explain more about this as we create the customers 
table. 
 The field names are going to be: 
 
id firstname 
surname 
title address 
phone

email 
 
So type those into the first colu mn of each row on the screen.  Note that we use all lower-case 
letters.  That way, we won’t have to worry  about remembering whether a field is called 
FirstName, firstname, Firstname or FIRSTNAME when we’re trying to access it later on.  Before we choose the "type" for each field, it’s important to consider for a moment our choice 
of fields.   
 
The "id" field exists because of our desire  for normalization, as mentioned on page 183.  Each 
time we refer to a customer within any table othe r than the "customers" one, we’ll do so by id 
number rather than name.   
 
You’ll see that we’ve split the customer’s name into 3 fields, namely firstname, surname and 
title.  So Mr John Smith will actually be stored as a firstname of John, a surname of Smith, and a title of Mr.  Why do we do it like this?  Because, thinking ahead, we might want to use 
our hotel management system to create mailshots, and we can easily construct the first line 
of the mailshot by printing the word "Dear" followed by the customer’s title and then their surname.   
 
The address, phone and email fields are fairly obvious.  Although, if you were creating this 
project "for real", you might want to consider sp litting the address into 4 or 5 separate fields, 
and perhaps a separate one for the postcode or zip code.  Why?  Because you might want to 
create reports or mailshots based on specific postcodes, and it’s much easier to search a database table by one specific field (eg, show me all the cu stomers whose postcode starts 
with TN) rather than searching within a larg er non-specific field (eg, show me all the 
customers where the letters TN appear somewhere within the address field).  
Don’t underestimate the value of  thinking ahead in this way.   W h e n  y o u ’ r e  p l a n n i n g  a n y  
database, the more thought and co nsideration you give to the way that your data is stored 
BEFORE you start writing code and firing up phpMyAdmin, the easier the task of creating 
the system will be.  The decision to store a customer name in 3 separate fields is trivial to 
implement at this stage.  If you were to go ahead with a single field called "name",  then write 
half the system, and then decide th at actually it would be better to store the name in 3 parts, 
it might take many days or even weeks to rewrite all the relevant parts of the system. 
 Anyway, back to our field creation screen.  Hope fully you’ve typed in the 7 field names.  Now 
to choose their types. 
 
For the id field, choose MEDIUMINT.   An INT field stores an integer, ie a whole number.  
You can’t store text in there, and you can’t store decimal numbers such as 3.5.  But we’ll use 
whole numbers for customer id’s so that’s fine.  Why medium rather than a TINYINT or

BIGINT or plain INT?  Because each can stor e a different range of numbers.  TINYINT can 
only store numbers between 1 and 255, which clearly isn’t enough to give every member of a 
hotel’s customer database a unique number.  MEDIUMINT  stores up to 16 million (or -8m 
to +8m if you’re going to want negative numbers in there too, which we don’t).  And that’s 
plenty for us.  If we need to change it later, we can do so without losing data.  
 
Firstname, surname and title can all be TINYTEXT, which allows up to 255 characters of 
text.  The address might conceivably be too long for this, so we’ll use a TEXT type, which 
allows up to 65,000 characters or so.  Not th at we’ll ever use that many, and nor will MySQL 
require 65,000 characters of disk space for every field in the database.  But the space is there 
for the database to be sufficiently expanded should we use it. 
 TINYTEXT will also suffice for the phone and email fields.  
 
There’s one more thing we need to do.  Scroll the screen sideways and you’ll see some more 
options for each field: 
 
 
  
In the "Extra" entry for the id field, and only for this field , choose the auto_increment 
option.   Each time you create a new row in the table, ie a new customer record, MySQL will

automatically generate a new unique id number.  It saves you having to manually write code 
to look for an unused id number.   
 As for all the other options, such as Attribut es, Null, Default and so on, you can leave these 
alone.  They are not required here.   Typically, all you need is a field name, a field type, and possibly an auto_increment on your id field.  
When you’re done, click on the Save button an d you should see a summ ary of the table that 
has been created.  That’s it.  The job is done. 
 
In the left hand panel, click on the database name (thewebbo_hms in this example).  You will 
now see a list of all the tables in that database, of which there is currently just one.  So click 
on "customers" and you’ll see the structure of the table like this: 
 
 
 
Get used to this screen, as you’ll be using it a lot when you start to become a regular user of 
phpMyAdmin.  The "structure" tab shows you the field names and types.  The other tabs that 
we’ll use later are "browse" and "insert", which let you look at the data and create new rows.  
Before we go any further, there are two fundamental things that you need to make sure you understand.  First, the database and all its da ta resides on the web server.  There’s nothing

 Second, everything we’re doing so far is conc erned with setting up the basic database and 
structure.  We’re using phpMyAdmin to do so be cause it makes the job easy.  The visitors to 
our site will never see phpMyAdmin, or any of the screens that we’ve used so far.  They will interact with the database using some much fr iendlier screens, which will comprise the hotel 
management system proper.  The only reason we’re not using those screens is because we haven’t written them yet!  That’s where PHP will come in, later on. 
Inserting Some Data 
 
The customers table is now created.  Let’s use phpMyAdmin to insert some customer records 
into it.  Later, when we’ve wri tten the necessary PHP code to implement this part of our hotel 
management system, we’ll be able to do it that  way.  But for now, this private "back door" 
route via phpMyAdmin will suffice. 
 In the left hand panel, click your database and table.  Then, in the top row of tabs, click on 
Insert and the screen will look like this:

Fill in the right-hand boxes for each field, as shown above.  Ignore the "function" boxes as 
these aren’t required. 
 Note how I haven’t filled in the id box.  This is an auto-increment field, so MySQL should 
take care of this.  We’ll find out, in a moment, whether it does. 
 When you’ve completed filling in the fields, click the Go button underneath the final field.    
Then click the "browse" tab at the top of the screen, and you should see this: 
 
 
 It worked.  In the centre of the screen you can see the row of data that you entered into the database.  John Smith’s information, complete with an automatically-generated id of 1, is 
there.  Before we declare this task finished, let’s add another row.  Click the "Insert" tab again, and 
create another customer.  Then click Browse to ensure that it’s been inserted correctly, as is shown here:

Our two rows have been given id’s of 1 and 2.  This is as you might expect.  However, the MySQL database system makes no guarantees about the pattern of automatically-generated 
numbers, except that they will be integers and they will be unique.  For example, if we have 3 
r o w s  i n  t h e  t a b l e ,  w i t h  i d ’ s  o f  1 , 2  a n d  3 ,  a n d  t h e n  w e  d e l e t e  t h e  s e c o n d  e n t r y ,  t h e  t w o  remaining entries will have id’s of 1 and 3.  When  we insert another row, will it be given an id 
of 2?  Or will it be allocated a 4, on the basis that this is the lowest number that hasn’t yet been used?   
The answer is: no one knows.  Either is a possi bility, because "1,2,3" and "1,2,4" both fit the 
rule of being integers and unique.  Sure, ther e’s a gap in the second set, but MySQL never 
guarantees that there won’t be gaps.  This is important because, for example, you might want 
to produce a report which tells the user how many customers are on file in the database.  
Clearly you can’t do it by searching for the hi ghest-numbered id.  Instead, you have to ask 
MySQL to tell you explicitly how many rows there are in the table.  Not difficult, so long as 
you know what question to ask.

Before we leave phpMyAdmin and the creation of MySQL databases and tables, there’s one 
more topic that we need to cover.  This is actually crucially important, although it might not 
seem so right now.  
What we’re about to do is to query the customers table in order that MySQL will return the 
data we ask for.  The reason that this concept is so important,  is because the techniques we use here are the same ones we’ll use later within our PHP code. 
 
Click on the SQL tab and you’ll see the following: 
 
 
 
SQL stands for Structured Query Language.  It’s an entire computer language that was 
specifically invented for querying da tabases using an English-like syntax. 
 
In the query box which currently says SELECT  * FROM `customers` WH ERE 1, change this 
to:  
select firstname from customers 
 
Then press the Go button and you should see:

Congratulations, you’ve just exec uted your first SQL query.   
 
select firstname from customers  should be fairly self-explanatory.  You’ve told 
MySQL to select a specific field (firstname) from a specific table (customers).  As you can see 
from the resulting screen, this is  exactly what it has done.  You now have a single column of 
results, namely all of the first names (John and Jane).  There’s no guarantee as to which order the data  w i l l  c o m e  o u t .   S o m e t i m e s ,  a s  h e r e ,  t h e  
names will appear in the order that they were orig inally entered, but this should not be relied 
upon.  If you want to specify an order, you need to use the ORDER BY command as part of the query.  Like this: 
 
select firstname from customers order by firstname 
 
So now our SQL command tells th e database what field we want  (SELECT), from what table 
( F R O M ) ,  a n d  h o w  t o  s o r t  t h e  r e s u l t s  ( O R D E R  B Y ) .   I n  t h i s  c a s e ,  w e  w a n t  t o  o r d e r  b y  t h e  
firstname field.  We could just as easily have used "order by email" or "order by surname" if 
we wanted to sort them in that way. 
 Let’s retrieve the full names (title, firstnam e and surname) of all our customers, using:

proper hotel management system, but at least we have a database that we can soon start to access via PHP. 
 
If you want to select all of the fields in a row, just use an asterisk like this:

Which will produce:

 The final component of the SELECT command that you need to know is WHERE.  Have a 
look at the following MySQL command: 
 
SELECT * FROM `customers` WHERE id = 2 
 
As you might expect (try it!), it returns the following:

It brings back the row whose id is 2.    
Now try:

Here’s what gets returned.  As you might expect, it’s John’s record:

One more example:  
SELECT firstname,surname FROM customers WHERE surname="Allen" 
 
And here, as you have probably worked out by now, is what comes back:

 Note how "Allen" and "John" need quotes ar ound them when used as part of a WHERE 
clause, whereas 1 (as an id) doesn’t.  That’s because firstname and surname are text fields.  The id field is a numeric field, which doesn’t.  If you search for the record which has an id of 
"1" rather than an id of 1, nothing will be found. 
 
For this reason,  som e MySQL  prog ra mm ers l ike  to inclu de  a clue  a s to the  type  of a  fie l d, within the name of the field itself.  For example, instead of creating a field called firstname, 
they’ll create one called tt_firstname, where tt stands for TinyText.  And instead of id they’ll 
use int_id.  That way, it’s pretty obvious that:  
select * from customers where int_id = "72" 
 
isn’t going to return any results,  because int_id is a numeric field and so the 72 shouldn’t be 
in quote marks.    Whether you adopt this style is entirely up to you.  Personally, I don’t.  Instead, I try to 
ensure that I use text fields for everything except id’s.  Then, I know that every field name except id needs to be in quotes.

So now you know the basics of the SELECT command, to return one or more rows from a 
table based on a particular criterion.    As you might expect, the SELECT command is much 
more powerful than this, and the official documentation for it runs to dozens of pages.  But this will do for now. 
 
With this basic knowledge of MySQL and the SE LECT command, it’s time to move on to the 
most advanced section of this book, namely the PHP programming language.  Which, as 
you’re about to see, makes it possible to do just  about anything on a web page.  If you’ve ever 
wondered how sites such as eBay and Amazon are created, or programs such as Joomla, 
you’re about to find out. 
 
Don’t delete your hms database from the serv er, by the way.  You’ll need it later on.

Introducing PHP 
 
On page 166 I talked about Javascript.  This is a cl ient-side language that allow you to write 
programs which get run in, and by, the web browse r of someone who visits your site.   It’s 
now time to leave client-side languages behind, and talk about server-side programming instead.  
Like Javascript, server-side languages allow you to write programs that add features and 
functionality to web sites.  But, as the name should hopefully suggest, the big difference is 
that server-side programs are run by, and on, th e web server itself.  The visitor's web browser 
doesn’t get involved, except to di splay the output of the program. 
 There are many server-side programming languages around, all of which do pretty much the 
same thing.  The one you decide to use will mostly depend on what you feel most comfortable 
with, and what’s offered by the hosting company that runs your server.  Unless you run your 
own web server you’ll be limited in the server -side languages that are available to you, as 
hosting companies won’t allow you to install your own.    Among the most popular server-side languages are PHP, Perl, Ruby, ASP.NET, Python, Java 
and ColdFusion.  Some are proprietary, such  as ASP.NET and ColdFusion, while Perl and 
PHP have the advantage of being open source, free, and available for servers that run either Linux or Windows.  Consequently, they are offe red by almost all web hosting companies.  Of

programs and 15,000 PHP ones for download. 
 
PHP, which stands for PHP Hy pertext Processor, is the most widely used server-side 
language in the web world, so th at’s what we’ll be using.  And yes, the first "P" does indeed 
stand for PHP.  Computer people are like that, sometimes.   
Don’t Panic! 
 
The remainder of this chapter i s  a l l  a b o u t  p r o g r a m m i n g .   I f  y o u ’ v e  e v e r  d o n e  c o m p u t e r  
programming before, in languages such as Basic or C or Visual Basic, then you should feel 
right at home.  If you haven’t, don’t worry.  This section is written for non-programmers so 
hopefully everything will make sense.  You will, though, find that it helps to put aside this 
book occasionally and practice on your own.  As with any language, foreign or computer, 
practice makes perfect.  Or at least better. 
 
As you start to discover the power of PHP, you’ ll probably want to start working on a "real" 
project alongside our example hotel management system.  Maybe it’s a project that you’ve

always wanted to write but have never known how.  Or maybe it’s something that only 
entered your mind as you were reading this book.  But it’s a project nonetheless, and you 
reckon you could be the next  Mr Facebook or Mrs Ebay. 
 
Although PHP is easy to learn, it takes time t o  l e a r n  h o w  t o  d o  i t  r i g h t .   A n d  i n  w e b  
programming, "right" generally means "secure" and "fast".  If you don’t do it "right", you’ll 
end up with a site that is easy for people to ha ck into, or which takes 15 minutes to produce a 
database report that should ta ke less than half a second. 
 
So here’s my advice, which I strongly sugges t that you follow.  Start off with the hotel 
m a n a g e m e n t  e x a m p l e s  t h a t  f o l l o w .    B y  a l l  m e a n s  u s e  t h e m  a s  t h e  b a s i s  f o r  f u r t h e r  
experimentation, to learn more about PHP and web programming.  But give it a couple of

disappointed, with a system that doesn’t do what you’d hoped it would.  At worst, you’ll end 
up with something that you’re convinced is goin g to be the Next Big Web Thing, only to have 
your hopes dashed when a student on anothe r continent hacks your customer database. 
 
Oh, and if all this makes you want to start look ing for the chapter on PHP security, there isn’t 
one.  Building secure web a pplications isn’t about reading the chapter on security and 
applying it to what you’ve already learned.  It ’s about doing everything in a secure way from 
the start.  So rather than teach you about secu r i t y  n o w ,  o r  a t  t h e  e n d ,  I ’ l l  a c t u a l l y  c o v e r  
security at every point where it is relevant. Wh i c h ,  a s  y o u ’ l l  s o o n  r e a l i s e ,  i s  j u s t  a b o u t  
everywhere. 
Your First PHP Program 
 A PHP program is just a text file, like any ot her Web page.  Most HT ML editors don’t know 
about PHP, though, so it’s best to use one that does.  That way, the editor will automatically alert you if it notices you’ve made an e rror in the code that you’re typing.   
 
Thankfully, PSPad, which we used for creating our Javascript code, also knows about PHP.  
Hundreds of thousands of people across the wo rld use PSPad as their PHP editor, so that’s 
what we’ll use too.  
While Javascript files tend to have a .html or .htm extension, just like standard web pages, 
PHP files tend to end with .php instead.  This  isn’t a hard and fast rule.  Some web servers 
will allow php code to exist within .html files, but many insist on you ending all your files 
with a .php extension.  So, to keep things simple  and consistent, we’ll stick to a rule of always 
using a .php extension on any file that contains PHP code.

Right, the time has come to write a PHP program.  If you haven’t already installed PSPad, 
you’ll need to follow the instructions on page 162 and do so.  With PSPad installed, launch 
the program.  Click the FTP tab on the left hand side of the screen, then click the Connect 
FTP icon in the row below it, and choose your si te name from the list that appears.  Then 
double-click on the public_html folder, or whatever your host uses to store your web-accessible files.  
In the white space below the list of files and folders on the left hand side, right-click and 
choose New File.  In the box where you’re aske d to choose a file name, type demo.php and 
click the OK button.  You should see your new fi le appear in the list in the left-hand panel. 
 
Now double-click your demo.php file to open it for editing.  Look at the blue title bar at the top of the screen, the text of  w h i c h  s h o u l d  e n d  w i t h  d e m o . p h p  r a t h e r  t h a n  n e w 1 . t x t  t o  
indicate that you’re editing the correct file.  If not, double-click it again. 
 You can now start typing your first PHP program.  Enter the following: 
 
<?php 
echo "<HTML>"; 
echo "<body>"; 
echo "This is some PHP"; echo "</body>"; 
echo "</HTML>"; 
?> 
 
The screen should now look like this:

 Save the file to the server (remember PSPad ha s built-in FTP so there’s no need to upload 
anything manually) by choosing Save from the Fi le menu.  After a couple of seconds, when 
the file is saved, you can close PSPad.  
Remember that, unlike Javascript, PHP code gets run by the web server, so you can’t write 
and test PHP programs unless you’re connected to a Web server.  Hence the need to upload 
our program. 
 
Let's see if everything worked.  Open your web browser and surf to the page you just created.  
In our case that’s www.the-web-book.com/demo.php  and the end result is:

Excellent.  It worked.  The web serv er recognised and ran our program. 
 
If you get an error message ab out syntax errors, go back and edit the file, and check your 
typing carefully.  If you just see the PHP code itself, check that  your web server really does 
support PHP and that it is enabled on your host ing account.  It’s possible that you have to 
specifically request it, th ough this is unusual. 
 
Although this is a very simple PHP program, it does demonstrate a number of key points 
about the language.  
First, you’ll notice that the code starts with <?php and ends with ?>.   These special markers 
tell the web server where PHP code starts and ends, rather like the  <script>  tag that 
marks the start of some Javascript.  Ea rlier versions of PHP allowed simply <? at the start of 
a script, but later versions insist on the full <?php instead.  So even if you see web-based 
tutorials or books that tell you it’s OK to use the shorter <? at the start, it’s not.  Get into the 
habit of using the full versio n and you’ll be better off. 
 
Next, notice the "echo" command.  This is rather like document.write in Javascript, in that it 
creates content which is sent to the visitor’s web browser to display.  In this case, we’ve 
created an entire HTML page consisting of <HTML> tags, <body> tags, and some text.  We have, in web developer terminology, created a dynamic web page.  There is no .html file on

the server that contains this page.  Instead, it has been dynamically created "on the fly", and 
sent to the visitor’s browser. 
 Not particularly impressive, sure , but I’ll show you some more  powerful examples shortly. 
 Note that you don’t have to stick to pure PHP code within a php file.  You can mix HTML and P H P  c o d e  w i t h i n  t h e  s a m e  f i l e .   F o r  e x a m p l e ,  w e  c o u l d  j u s t  a s  e a s i l y  h a v e  w r i t t e n  o u r  
program like this: 
 
<HTML> 
<body> 
<?php echo "This is some PHP"; 
?> 
</body> </HTML> 
 
Here, we stay in HTML mode to create the firs t two tags.  Then we switch to PHP mode to 
generate the text, and then back into HTML mode to generate the two closing tags. 
 
As you start to write longer PHP programs, deciding on which way to work is important.  There’s no right or wrong way – just do as you prefer.  Some people don’t like the idea of 
flipping in and out of PHP mode 20 or 30 times within a complex file, whereas others prefer 
to stick in HTML mode and only use PHP mode where it matters.  You’ll see more about this later, but for the moment you need to bear in mind that there are two ways of doing things. 
 
There’s one more vital thing you need to understand about PHP, and indeed every server-side programming language.  Assuming your we b browser is still open, hit the View Source 
menu option and look at the HTML source code of the page.  It looks like this:  
 
 
Note how you can see the output of the PHP program, and not the PHP program code 
itself.  The program was on the Web server, and the "echo" commands forced the HTML tags

This is crucial to understand.  It’s the difference between server-side and client-side 
programming.  And it means that you can safe ly use PHP to implement security-related 
features, because no one can tamper with the code. 
 
If we’d written this program in Javascript, as a series of document.write statements, using the View Source option on our browser would have displayed the Javascript program code.  
But in this case, the browser never gets to see the code because it has already been run by the 
server. 
 
One final point.  Why are there no blank lines between each of the HTML tags, and 
before/after the text?  Shouldn’t the dynamically-generated HTML code look more like this, 
rather than being all in one line?: 
 
<HTML> 
<body> 
This is some PHP 
</body> 
</HTML> 
 
The reason that there are no "carriage retu rn" characters in our dynamically-generated 
HTML, is because our PHP program never created any.  Sure, we put each line of PHP code 
on its own line, but that won’t cause carriage re turn characters to be sent to the browser. 
 
It doesn’t actually matter.  Browsers don’t insist on HTML code being neatly arranged in 
lines – it’s only done for the benefit of humans  who might want to read the code.  But if you 
did want to generate neat, line-spaced HT ML, you’d have to adjust your PHP code 
accordingly.   
 
Needless to say, there’s much more to PHP th an the "echo" command.  Like JavaScript, PHP 
is a hugely complex and capable language, which provides all of the tools you need to write 
sites such as eBay or Amazon.  Perhaps the grea test benefit of knowing how to do server-side 
programming is being able to interact with a MySQL database, and we’ll come to this soon.  
For now, though, the following chapter looks at some of the other things that PHP can do.

official www.php.net  site on the Web.  Although the site can be confusing, it does contain 
everything you’ll ever need to know.  Perhaps its best feature is that anyone can add their 
own comments and example to the online manual.    
To find out about any command in PHP, just go to www.php.net/xxxx , where xxxx is the 
command you want to know about.  Alternatively, if you don’t know what command to use, a 
Google search is a good place to start.  For example, I mentioned earlier that our code didn’t

Some More PHP 
 
As you’ll see if you browse the online documentation on www.php.net , there are literally 
thousands of commands and functions in the PH P language, to allow you to achieve just 
about anything you want to do with a web page.  It’s impossible to cover everything here, or 
even to scratch the surface of what can be achieved.  But before we progress to examine 
online databases, here’s a small selection of other PHP stuff that  might give you some ideas.  
Even if you don’t intend to use these right no w, you’re recommended to read through this 
section as it will help a lot when we come to the database section later. 
 
Incidentally, I've mentioned commands and functions.  Is there a difference?  Yes.  A 
command does something, like open a file or display a message.  A function returns 
information, such as the value of a data base field or the sum of two numbers. 
Random Numbers 
 Let’s imagine that, on a particular web page, we want to include a message on our home page 
which thanks visitors for looking at our site.  However, to avoid bombar ding people with the 
message, we only want to show it approximately one time in ten.  So, every ten times that the 
web server sends out the page to a visitor, it will include the message. 
 
One simple way to do this is with PHP’s random number generator.  There’s a PHP function which returns a random integer between 1 and an y  n u m b e r  w e  s p e c i f y .   S o  w e ' l l  a s k  i t  t o  
generate a number between 1 and 10, and only display the message if the number happens to 
be, say, 7.  This will result in the message only being shown approximately 10% of the time. 
That is to say, if 100 people visit the home page during one specific time period, roughly 10 
of them will see the message.   
 Open PSPad and navigate to your demo.php file.  Open it, delete everything that’s in it, and 
replace it with the following: 
 
<HTML> 
<body> 
Welcome to our site.<br><br>  
<?php 
$r = rand(1,10); if ($r == 7) 
{ 
echo "Thank you for visiting<br>";

 This is why PHP is so useful for generating dy namic HTML pages.  It can generate different 
pages each time (or just some of the time). 
 
Take a look at the source code of those 2 HTML  pages (use the View Source option in your 
browser).  Note how there’s no PHP code in there, just the HTML that our code dynamically 
generated.  The browser knows nothing about where the HTML code came from.  It merely 
sent a "please send me the contents of demo.php" request to the server, and the server ran 
your program and sent some HTML back.  Th e fact that the HTML was generated by a 
program, rather than being retrieved from a re ady-made .html file on the server, is unknown 
to the browser.

Again, we’ve introduced a couple of new PHP conc epts so let’s take anot her look at the code 
we just typed and uploaded.  Here it is ag ain, with line numbers to aid explanation: 
 
1   <HTML> 
2   <body> 
3   Welcome to our site.<br><br>  
 
4   <?php 
5   $r = rand(1,10); 
6   if ($r == 7) 
7   { 
8   echo "Thank you for visiting<br>"; 
9   } 
10  ?> 
 11  </body> 
12  </HTML> 
 
T h i s  t i m e ,  I ’ v e  c h o s e n  t o  m i x  H T M L  a n d  PHP mode, and only to use PHP mode when 
necessary.  So, to create our dynamically-generated HTML page, we start by outputting the 
necessary HTML and BODY tags.  Remember th at a PHP file always starts off in HTML 
mode, ie it’s just a standard HTML file as far as the web server is concerned.  Just because it 
has a .php extension doesn’t chan ge this.  The only reason for the php extension is to tell the 
server that, if there is any PHP code in the file, it’s safe to run it.  Some servers will also run 
PHP code that’s contained within a .HTM file, bu t many won’t.  And even if yours does, it’s a 
good habit to be able to identify, from its extension, whether a file is plain HTML or PHP. 
 Line 3 generates the first line of  text on the page, and I’ve added a couple of line break tags 
too, for clarity. (Now you can see why you ne ed to know basic HTML before you can start 
writing PHP, and thus why the chapters in this book are ordered the way they are).  
Once again, for clarity, I haven't created a css st yle sheet, or a doctype, or used <p> tags.  The 
program will still work just fine, as browsers  are generally pretty forgiving. When you're 
doing this for real, you'll need to do it properly. 
 
Lines 11 and 12 close the HTML page neatly, by  creating the closing body and HTML tags.  
Again, this is just standard HTML  which we learned much earlier. 
 Line 4 flips the server into PHP mode.  Line 5 creates a variable (we’ve called it $r) which 
uses the rand function.  In this particular instance , the $r variable will be set to a value 
between 1 and 10.  Note that every variable name in PHP has to be preceded with a dollar 
sign.  Variables don’t have to be given single-lette r names.  I could just as easily have called it

$my_random_value, but shorter is always best as  there’s less chance of making a typing 
mistake when you refer to th e same variable later on. 
 
Line 6 checks to see whether $r is equal to 7.  If it is, everything between the 2 curly brackets 
gets executed.  If it’s not, everything between the curly brackets gets ignored. 
 
Note two important points about th e code in line 6.  First, the if command is almost unique 
i n  P H P ,  i n  t h a t  i t  d o e s n ’ t  ( i n d e e d ,  m u s t n ’ t )  e n d  w i t h  a  s e m i c o l o n .   S e c o n d ,  w h e n  y o u ’ r e  
comparing something, you use 2 "equals"  signs rather than just one.  So, $x = 99  will set 
the variable $x to 99.  But to check whether $x is equal to 99 we say if ($x == 99) .  Note, 
too, how the value to check for has to go inside rounded brackets. 
 Incidentally, if you leave PHP mode and then re-enter it within the same file, no information 
is lost.  So, for example, the following: 
 
<html> 
 
<?php $name = "Fred"; 
?> 
 Your name is 
 
<?php echo $name; ?> 
 
</html> 
 
 
Will display the message Your name is Fred . 
Sending Email with PHP 
 
With server-side programming you can do just  about anything, and that includes sending 
email.  Try this little PHP program, by changing the contents of demo.php to the following and then surfing to the demo.php page:  
<?php 
$to = "robert@the-web-book.com"; $subject = "Hello"; 
$message = "This is my Web server, sending me email on "; 
$message .= date("D");

$message .= " at "; 
$message .= date("H:i"); 
$m = mail($to,$subject,$message); echo "Return code from mail was " . $m; 
exit(); 
?> 
 
You should see a message which says "Return code from mail wa s 1".  To understand why, 
and what this program does, let’s examine it in detail. 
 The first line of code creates a new variable called $to, which is set to the "to" address of the 
email we’re going to be sending.  In this case , I’m sending the message to myself.   If you 
want to try this example, please use your own email address rather than mine! 
 
The next line sets the subject of the message in a similar way, and then we create $message, which is the text of the actual message we’ll be sending. 
 
But what about $message .= date("D"); ?  Are we setting $message to something else 
entirely?  No.  Take a closer look and you’ll see we’re using .= rather than = on its own.  The 
.= symbol means that PHP should add the new te xt to the end of what’s in that variable 
already.  But what text to add?  In this case we’re using the date()  function and specifying 
"D" as what’s known as the argument.  The date()  function returns lots of time- and date-
related information, such as th e current day, date, hour, minute, second, year, and so on.  
There are dozens of possible things that it can return, each symbolized by their own letter 
(and these are case-sensitive, by the way, so d is not the same as D).   
 
In this case, D returns the current day of the week as a 3-letter abbreviation.  So, this line is 
adding a 3-letter version of today’s day onto th e end of the $message string which we created 
in the line above.  Thus, if today happens to be Friday, $message will now be "This is my Web 
server, sending me email on Fri".  
The next line adds " at " to the $message string .  So now it contains "This is my Web server, 
sending me email on Fri at ".  
 
Finally we add the current time to the end of the message that we’ll be emailing.  We use the 
date()  function again, with H and i.  H return s the current hour in 24-hour clock format, 
and i returns the number of minutes.  Anything that isn’t a letter, within the bracketed part 
of the date() f u n c t i o n ,  g e t s  r e t u r n e d  a s - i s .   S o  i f  t h e  t i m e  h a p p e n e d  t o  b e  9 p m ,  
date("H:i")  would return 21:00. 
 
PHP is particularly good at processing and manipulating strings and dates.  Whatever you 
need to do with a string (count the number of  characters, convert it to upper or lower case,

remove the last 4 characters, etc etc), PHP has a function to do it.  As for dates, there are 
even functions which will, if you supply a date and a latitude/longitude location, tell you the 
time of the sunrise or sunset.  
Right, back to our program.  Next, we use the mail() command to send the message.  It’s as 
simple as specifying, in the correct order, the "to" address, the "from" address, and the text of 
the message to be sent.  But note the $m = bit at the start, though.  The mail() function 
returns a value to indicate whet her the message was successfully sent to the mail server for 
delivery.  We capture this into the $m va riable, and display it in the next line. 
 
Finally, the exit() statement ends the PHP program.  You don’t need to use this if it’s 
unambiguous, as it is here.  The program is clearly going to end, as there’s no more PHP code left to run.  But that won’t always be the case, as we’ll see later. 
 
By surfing to the demo.php page, the program runs  and the mail gets sent.  The value of 1 for 
$m means that the mail message was successfu lly sent to the web server’s outgoing mail 
system.  It does NOT mean that the message was successfully sent to the recipient’s inbox.  
Unfortunately there’s no way of knowing that.  
A few minutes later, the following arrives in my inbox: 
  
 
 Here’s the message.  It has the correct subject, and the text of the message is there too.  But 
there are a couple of things to notice. 
 
First, the message appears to come from thewebbo@host368.hostmonster.com .  That’s 
not particularly friendly.  There’s an optional extra item that you can include in the mail() 
function to specify the address that the mess age appears to come fr om, though I haven’t 
bothered with it here.  In theory you can set th e "from:" address to be whatever you like.  But 
in practice, most web servers won’t send mail that appears to have come from anywhere 
outside of the domain name that the server is base d on.  So in this case I could send mail that

appears to come from robert@the-web-book.com  but not robert@microsoft.com .   
This rule is imposed to help prevent web host s from having their servers used by spammers. 
 
It’s important that you do set a "from:" address when sending mail.  Because that’s where the 
reply will be sent when the recipient hits thei r "reply" button.  I’d much rather the replies 
came to a real mailbox at robert@the-web-book.com  rather than something which I 
wouldn’t even know how to log into if I wanted. 
 
There’s one other discrepancy too.  See how the te xt of the message says that it was sent on 
Fri at 14.15.  But look in the upper window an d, according to my Outlook email program, the 
message was received at 21.15.  The message appeared in my inbox within seconds of me 
surfing to the demo.php page, so why does it appear to have taken 7 hours?  You will recall 
that PHP is a server-side language.  So when you use the date() function to find out the 
time, it looks up the time on the server.  Co mpare this to the client-side Javascript, which 
finds out the time on the visitor’s own PC.  Th e hostmonster web server is in the US, where 
it’s 2.15pm.  I’m in the UK, 7 hours ahead, where it’s 9.15pm, so that’s why the discrepancy 
arises.  And it’s well worth know ing a b ou t,  be cau se  it ca n lea d to prob lem s if you  cre a te  a 
web application that needs to know the correct (whatever that means, in this global market) 
time.   
Passing Information to PHP 
 There are various ways of passing information to a PHP program, and we’ll cover many of 
them in the database-related chapters that follow, and when we come to talk about HTML 
forms later on.  But here’s a fun example for now, which illustrates a couple of important 
points about PHP.   
 
Open PSPad, delete the contents of demo .php and replace it with the following: 
 
<?php 
$person = $_GET["name"]; 
echo "<HTML>"; echo "Hello "; 
echo $person; 
echo ", how are you today?"; echo "</HTML>"; 
?> 
 
Surf to the demo.php page an d you’ll see a message that sa ys "Hello , how are you today".

We can produce custom versions of this book for other web hosts.  Email info@the-web-book.com  for details. 
 
Now surf to the page again, but use the following URL.  Substitute the-web-book.com  for 
whatever your domain is called.  And you can change Robert to your own name if you wish, 
too: 
 
http://www.the-web-book.com/demo.php?name=Robert 
 
Note the question mark at th e end of the URL, followed by name=Robert .  You’ve probably 
s e e n  U R L s  l i k e  t h i s  b e f o r e ,  a n d  y o u  m i g h t  h a v e  w o n d e r e d  w h a t  t h e y  m e a n t .   N o w  y o u ’ r e  
going to find out.  
T h e  q u e s t i o n  m a r k  i n  a  U R L  a l l o w s  y o u  t o  s u r f  t o  a  s e r v e r - s i d e  p r o g r a m  ( i n  t h i s  c a s e  o n e  
called demo.php) and also to pass information to the program.  In this case, we have created 
a variable called name with a value of Robert .  The PHP program can, if it wishes, retrieve 
the contents of that variable. 
 Along with the question mark, the other symbol that you use for passing information to PHP 
programs via the URL is the ampersand (&) sign.  This is used when you want to pass more 
than one variable.  For example:  
http://www.the-web-book.com/demo.php?firstname=Robert&surname=Smith 
 
Here, we’re passing 2 variables called firstname and surname.  Note how only the first 
variable is preceded by a question mark.  Any subsequent variables must be preceded by an 
ampersand.   
Back to our demo.php program.  Assuming you entered a name of Robert on the URL, you’ll 
see the following in your web browser:

To understand how this works, take another look at the PHP program code. The only line 
that will be unfamiliar to you is  $person = $_GET["name"]; 
 
The $_GET[" "]  syntax is how you retrieve variable s (known as parameters in this 
context) that were added to the end of the URL.  In this case, because we referred to the 
parameter as name in the URL, $_GET["name"]  retrieves it for us.  I’m retrieving it into a 
variable called $person rather than $n ame, but that’s enti rely up to you. 
 
Note that the URL variable in the square brackets  doesn’t have a dollar sign at the start, so 
$_GET["$name"]  wouldn’t work.  And note that GET is  in upper case – this is important 
too.  If you’ve got a few minutes spare, here’s some thing that you can try.  Enhance the program 
so that, if no name is entered on the URL, the program displays an error message.  To do 
this, you’ll need to know that the strlen()  function returns the length, in characters, of a 
string.  So having retrieved the name from the URL, code such as: 
 
if (strlen($person) == 0) 
 
will allow you to find out wh ether any name was supplied. 
 
Alternatively, adapt the program to display not just the name that was entered, but also the 
number of characters in the name.  
Never Forget to Sanitize 
 Being able to pass information to a PHP program so  easily is a good one, and you’ll find that 
y o u  u s e  i t  a  l o t .   M o s t l y,  i t ’ s  u s e d  i n  f o r m s .   F o r  e x a m pl e ,  y o u r  v i s i t o r  f i l l s  i n  a  w e b - b a se d  form with his name and address, which gets retrieved by a PHP program and displayed on 
screen or added to a database.  But the ease  with which PHP can accept information from 
visitors to your site hides a very serious security flaw.  You can’t trust that information, because the visitor is free to enter anything he or she likes.  
Here’s a very simple example.  Surf to demo.php again by using the following URL: 
 
http://www.the-web-book.com/demo.php?name=<b>Robert</b> 
 
This is what you’ll see in your Web browser:

See how my name is now displayed in bold?  That’s because I added the relevant HTML tags 
to the URL.  The PHP program uses the echo statement to insert, into the dynamically-
generated web page, whatever was specified on the URL.  In this case it’s not just some text, but some actual HTML code too.  You can see it if you use the View Source option in your 
web browser. 
 But why is this bad?  Because, at a trivial le vel, someone can mess up the look of your web 
page by forcing it to display lots of stray HTML tags.  At the other end of the scale, consider what would happen if someone entered a "name" of  <script> followed by a load of Javascript 
code.  Would the web browser then exec ute that code?  Yes, it would.   
 All of which leads to one of the most fundamental rules of security when it comes to PHP programming: filter or sanitize information whose source you can’t be sure of. 
 
Quite how you do this will depend on circumstan ces, and on the precise nature of the data. 
In our current example, where we’re expecting the visitor to enter a name, it’s obvious that 
the only characters we need to allow are the le tters a to z (and A to Z).  Any other character 
can be removed.  This will include the pointy brackets which would allow someone to enter 
HTML code, and also many other unnecessary pu nctuation symbols.  You’ ll see later, when 
we talk about SQL Injection attacks, that some of those other punctuatio n symbols are just as 
dangerous.  
One way to filter or sanitize data is to use the PHP str_replace  function.  This stands for 
"string replace".  It can quickly and easily replac e any characters in a string (ie, in a variable 
that corresponds to some text) with another char acter.  Or, if you prefer, it can replace them 
with nothing and thus delete them. 
 For example, having retrieved the name from the URL into the $person variable, we could 
then add a line which says: 
 
$person = str_replace("<","",$person); 
 
As you can see, str_replace  requires 3 parameters.  What to search for, what to replace it 
with, and the variable within which to do it.  This line would have the effect of replacing all < 
symbols in $person with no thing, ie deleting them.

Although this would work, you’d need lots of str_replace lines to deal with every unwanted 
character that you need to filter out.  But th ankfully there’s a neater way, using a function 
called ereg_replace .  Take a look at this: 
 
$person = ereg_replace("[^A-Za-z0-9 .,';:?]", "", $person); 
 
This is similar to str_replace, in that you specify what you want to look for, what you want to 
replace it with, and the string to operate on.  But take a closer look at what we’re searching 
for.  No longer are we specifying a single character, but: 
 
[^A-Za-z0-9 .,';:?] 
 
Although this might look like gobbledygook, it’s actually just shorthand for the entire list of 
characters to search for.  Let’s go through it in detail.  First, the whole thing goes in square brackets, because that’s the rule for ereg_replace.  A-Z means every character from A to Z.  Equally, a-z means all the lower-case letters.  Then , in addition to those 52 characters, we list 
a few others.  Namely the space, full stop , comma, apostrophe, semicolon, colon, and 
question mark.    
The most important character in this  whole collection, though, is the ^ at the start.  This is 
ereg_replace shorthand for "everything except".  So what the whole command actually does, 
is to replace every character in $person with a blank (ie, to delete that character), EXCEPT 
where the character is a letter, a space,  a comma, an apostrophe, and so on. 
 
You don’t really have to understand it.  Just add this line to your PHP code, after the line 
which retrieves $person from the URL.  Now surf to demo.php again and try entering 
"forbidden" characters.  You’ll notice that they don’t appear in the generated web page. 
 
Sanitizing strings is fiddly but, thankfully, it only normally takes just  line or two of extra 
code.  And it is vital that you do sanitize ever y string that comes from a visitor to your site, 
because you have no idea what the visitor has ty ped.  Get into the habit now.  Every time you 
use $_GET to retrieve information from a URL, sanitise  it before using it.  Failure to do this 
will mean that your site WILL get hacked. 
 
Incidentally, the idea of deleting everything EX CEPT a specified range of characters isn't just 
convenience, it also makes a lot of sense from a security perspective too.  It's much better to 
say "these are the characters I'm going to allow" , rather than "I'm going to allow everything 
a p a r t  f r o m  t h e  f o l l o w i n g " .   I n  t h e  l a t t e r  c a s e ,  f o r g e t t i n g  t o  a d d  s o m e t h i n g  t o  y o u r  l i s t  o f  
banned characters poses a serious security risk.  In the former case, there's no risk of this

happening, and the worst that can happen is that some characters won't get through until 
you remember to add them to the list.   
Loop the Loop 
 
Every programming language has a number of methods for creating loops, and PHP is no 
exception.  Try this program, for example, either by uploading it the server and seeing what happens, or just by reading the code and trying to work it out:  
<?php 
echo "<HTML>"; echo "<body>"; 
 
echo "A web server that knows its 7 times table!<br><br>"; 
 
for ($x = 1; $x <= 10; $x++) 
{ echo $x . " times 7 is " . $x * 7 . "<br>"; 
} 
 echo "</body>"; 
echo "</HTML>"; 
?> 
 
Run the program, and you'll see the following in your web browser:

One line of PHP that you'll not have seen before is:  
for ($x = 1; $x <= 10; $x++) 
 
This is one of PHP's methods of creating a loop.  In this case, it's a "for" loop.  If you ever 
learnt to program in Basic many years ago, it's just the same as a FOR…NEXT loop in that language. 
 
T r a n s l a t i n g  t h e  l i n e  o f  P H P  i n t o  E n g l i s h ,  t h e  l i n e  o f  c o d e  m e a n s :  s e t  v a r i a b l e  $ x  t o  1 ,  a n d  
execute everything within the curly brackets that follow.  If $x is less than, or equal, to 10, 
exit the loop and jump to the first line of code  after the section in curly brackets.  Otherwise, 
add 1 to $x and go round again.  
The $x++ is a PHP shorthand way of saying "add 1 to $x".  Another way, which works just as 
well and which is more familiar to Basic programmers, is $x = $x + 1 .  
 
By changing the starting value (1) and the finishing va lue (10), you can adapt this code to run 
as many times as you like. Try it.  As for generating our 7 times table, the line that does all the work is: 
 
echo $x . " times 7 is " . $x * 7 . "<br>"; 
 
Here, we’ve used a single echo statement to produc e the entire line of our table.  Each part of 
the line is separated by a dot.  Literal text such as times 7 is   g e t s  e n c l o s e d  i n  q u o t e  
marks, whereas we leave the quote marks out if we want PHP to echo the value of a variable 
such as $x, or make a calculation such as $x * 7.   
 Don't forget that, whenever you write a PHP program, you're creating a program that will 
generate a web page.  This needs to be a valid web page, complete with <HTML> and 
<body> tags.  Otherwise, the visi tor's web browser may get confused. 
 Another type of loop that's used extensively in PHP, especially when accessing MySQL 
databases, is the "while" loop.  Here's the 7 ti mes table again, this time using a "while" loop: 
 
<HTML> 
<body>  
My web server still knows its 7 times table

<?php 
$i=1; while($i <= 10) 
  { 
  echo $i;   echo " times 7 is "; 
  $product = $i * 7; 
  echo $product . "<br>";   $i = $i + 1; 
  } 
?>  
</body> 
</HTML> 
 
Just to be different, I've mixed HTML and PHP modes this time.   
 
Notice how a "while" loop works.  First, we set $i to 1.  Then we create the loop, which says 
"do the block of code within the curly brackets, bu t only while $i is less than, or equal to, 10". 
 
Because there's a line within the block which ad ds 1 to $i, there will come a point at which $i 
is not less than or equal to 10, so the progra m will fall through to the next line after the 
closing curly bracket.  
It's worth studying these two ex amples of loops, and especially  the "while" loop, as they are 
used extensively in database-related PHP programming.  
Arrays 
 Programming in PHP is all about manipulating va riables, ie those item s of data whose name 
starts with a dollar sign.  The key to manipulating data is to ensure that the data is stored in 
the most efficient way, in order to make the manipulation as efficient as possible. 
 
For example, let's return to the subject of our hotel management system and put together a 
list of all the drinks available at the bar.  We want to store the drinks menu in a set of 
variables, so that we can display them, sort them, record orders for them, and so on.  Here's 
one way of doing it:  
$drink0 = " Whiskey"; 
$drink1 = "Brandy";

$drink2 = "Pint of lager"; 
$drink3 = "Shandy"; 
$drink4 = "White wine (large)"; $drink5 = "White wine (small)"; 
$drink6 = "Red wine (large)"; 
$drink7 = "Red wine (small)";  
Having defined our variables, we now want to  use a set of echo commands to display the 
d r i n k s  m e n u  o n  s c r e e n .   B u t  h o w ?   E a c h  d r i n k  n a m e  i s  s t o r e d  i n  a  c o m p l e t e l y  s e p a r a t e  
variable.  Sure, each one star ts with the letters d,r,i,n an d k, but then come different 
numbers.  As far as PHP is concerned, the variables are totally unrelated to each other, even 
though their names are similar.  Displayi ng our menu is going to be difficult. 
 
There's a better way, using something called an array.  An array lets you create a group of 
variables which are linked, and you can easily access any member of the chain.  Here's how 
to do it: 
 
$drink[0] = " Whiskey"; $drink[1] = "Brandy"; 
$drink[2] = "Pint of lager"; 
$drink[3] = "Shandy"; $drink[4] = "White wine (large)"; 
$drink[5] = "White wine (small)"; 
$drink[6] = "Red wine (large)"; $drink[7] = "Red wine (small)"; 
 
Note the minor addition of those square brackets .  They're important.  No longer do we have 
8 separate variables.  Instead, we have one si ngle array which has 8 elements.   Note how we 
started at zero, by the way.  In PHP, array elem ents generally start at zero.  This is a slight 
pain, as it means the final element of a 10-element array is number 9 rather than 10.  But once you get used to it, and remember to writ e your program code accordingly, it's pretty 
simple.  Here's where arrays come in so useful.  To disp lay the value of drink number 3, we just use 
echo $drink[3]  as you might expect.  But even better, we can use a loop to display the full 
drinks menu like this:  
<?php 
$drink[0] = "Whiskey"; $drink[1] = "Brandy"; 
$drink[2] = "Pint of lager"; 
$drink[3] = "Shandy";

$drink[4] = "White wine (large)"; 
$drink[5] = "White wine (small)"; 
$drink[6] = "Red wine (large)"; $drink[7] = "Red wine (small)"; 
 
echo "<HTML>"; echo "<body>"; 
 
echo "Drinks Menu<br><br>";  
for ($i = 0; $i <= 7; $i++) 
{ echo $drink[$i]; 
echo "<br>"; 
}  
echo "</body>"; 
echo "</HTML>";  
?> 
 
Which displays the following in the visitor's web browser: 
 
 
 
Our "for" loop counts from 0 to 7, and displays the relevant element of the array each time. 
 
The only slight annoyance is that, if we add another drink to the menu by creating element number 8, we'd also have to change the 7 to an 8 in the "for" loop.  This is inconvenient, and

introduces the possibility of an error in the program if we forget to do this.  As you might 
expect, there's a way round it.  Just change the "for" loop to: 
 
$total_drinks = count($drink); 
for ($i = 0; $i <= $total_drinks; $i++) 
 
The count() function returns the number of elements in the specified array.  But remember 
that arrays start at zero, so treat the returned count accordingly.  In this case, the function 
returns 9, but that doesn't mean the highest-numbered drink is element 9. The list starts at 
0, so the highest-numbered element will be one less than the value which count() returns. 
 
When you're adding data to an array, you don't even have to specify the numeric bit if you don't want to.  The following will work ju st fine, and PHP will allocate the numbers 
automatically, starting from zero.  This is ha ndy if you're reading a list of items from a 
database and you want to add them to an array in order to manipulate them. 
 
$drink[] = "Whiskey"; 
$drink[] = "Brandy"; $drink[] = "Pint of lager"; 
$drink[] = "Shandy"; 
$drink[] = "White wine (large)"; $drink[] = "White wine (small)"; 
$drink[] = "Red wine (large)"; 
$drink[] = "Red wine (small)"; 
 
PHP has lots of useful functions for manipulating data in arrays.  For example, array_sort  
does what you might expect, allo wing you to add just one line of code to the above program 
to present the list of drinks in alphabetical or der. Although, if you we re reading the list of 
drinks from a database table, it's far more efficient to use the ORDER BY  clause as part of the 
MySQL query, in order to retrieve a ready-sorted list, rather than read the data in a random 
order from the database and then sort it within the array. 
  
Before we finish our very brief introduction to arrays, there's something important that you need to know about them.  In some languages, su ch as Basic, array subscripts (ie, the bit in 
square brackets) have to be sequential and numeric.  In PHP, this is not the case.  We could, if we wish, create our array of drinks thus:  
$drink["a"] = "Whiskey"; 
$drink["fred"] = "Brandy"; $drink[2] = "Pint of lager"; 
$drink["hello"] = "Shandy"; 
$drink[412] = "White wine (large)";

$drink["-8"] = "White wine (small)"; 
$drink[6] = "Red wine (large)"; 
$drink[7923] = "Red wine (small)"; 
 
It's unlikely that you'd ever want to do this (a t least, I hope not!), but it's worth bearing in 
mind the pitfalls of not having subscripts (or keys, as PHP calls them) which follow a pattern.  
Why?  Because, if you use the count() function to return the tota l number of elements in an 
array, you can only use the for.. loop method as described above if you know that the 
elements are numeric, sequential, start at 0, and stop at one less than the value returned by 
the count() function.  If they don't, you'll need to find another way of displaying them.  
 Should you need to do this, there's a PHP function called array_keys()  that returns (as an 
array, naturally) the list of element names of a given array.  In this case it would return an 
array consisting of a, fred, 2, hello, 412, -8, 6 and 7923. You could then use this array to help 
you navigate the $drinks array.  
Be aware that, if you delete an element from an array using the unset command, the 
remaining array will have a "hole" in it.  For ex ample, we currently have our array of drinks 
from 0 (whiskey) to 7 (small red wine).  We then delete element 3 (shandy) because it's no 
longer available on the menu.  We can do this with: 
 
unset $drinks[3]; 
 
There are now 7 elements in the array, numbered 0,1,2,4,5,6,7.  A call to count($drinks) will return 7, but those elements aren't numbered 0 to 6.  Instead, they're numbered 0 to 7 with a 
non-existent 3. 
 
The easiest way around this is to renumber the array and close up the gaps  every time you 
delete an element.  Which is as simple as: 
 
$drinks = array_values($drinks); 
 
N o w ,  $ d r i n k s  h a s  e l e m e n t s  n u m b e r e d  0  t o  6 .   J u s t  r e m e m b e r  t o  c a l l  t h e  c o u n t ( )  f u n c t i o n  again, so the number of the highest element is updated. 
 
If you've ever used arrays in Basic before, trust me.  This will  catch you out! 
User-Defined Functions 
 
PHP programmers make great use of something called user-defined functions.  So far, we've 
used only PHP's built-in functions like  count() , mail() , strlen() and so on.  But the

great thing about PHP is that you can create your own.  For example, here’s a slightly 
different version of the “how are you today?" program as shown on page 222: 
 
<?php 
$person = $_GET["name"]; 
$person_san = sanitize_url_string($person); echo "<HTML>"; 
echo "Hello "; 
echo $person_san; echo ", how are you today?"; 
echo "</HTML>"; 
exit();  
function sanitize_url_string($string) 
{ $s = ereg_replace("[^A-Za-z0-9 .,';:?]", "", $string); 
return $s; 
} ?> 
 
There are a couple of differences between this version and the original .  First, after using 
$_GET to retrieve the value of the na me from the URL, we then call the 
sanitize_url_string() function to clean it up and re move any potentially dangerous 
characters.  The function itself is defined further down, so we need an exit()  statement 
before the function definition, in order that the code which defines the function doesn’t get 
executed.  It doesn’t need to be – PHP will search for it automatically in the file if it needs it. 
 
Note how I’ve created a new, sanitized version of $person, called $person_san, and this is 
the version that gets displayed by the echo st atement.  I could, instead, just have said: 
 
$person = sanitize_url_string($person); 
 
which would have replaced the unsanitized version with the clean one.  But it’s a good idea to get into the habit of giving all sanitized data an  easily identifiable moniker, such as _san.  
That way, it’s easy to spot places in your programs where you might have forgotten to clean up toxic data.   
Finally, the definition of the func tion itself. This takes the form of a line which starts with the 
word “function”, then the name you want to use,  then, in brackets, the list of however many 
p a r a m e t e r s  y o u r  f u n c t i o n  r e q u i r e s .   I n  t h i s  c a s e  i t  n e e d s  j u s t  o n e ,  n a m e l y  a  s t r i n g  t o  b e  sanitized.  The name of the va riable ($string) within the func tion definition needs to match 
the name used within the code of the functi on, but doesn’t have to match the name used

happens that we’re using the function to sanitize a person’s name.  Later on in our program 
we might call the same function to  sanitize $postcode or $occupation. 
 
Note the return c o m m a n d .   T h i s  i s  w h a t  r e t u r n s  t h e  results, ie the sanitized string, to 
whatever called the function. Without this, $person_san would be blank. 
 
One of the characteristics of "good" programming , whether in PHP or any other language, is 
that you don't include the same bit of code more than once.  Whether that "bit of code" is a 
single line or a block of 100 lines, the rule still applies.  By including the code just once, and 
turning it into a function which can then be  referred to many times, your programming 
becomes more efficient.  It saves space, and mean s that, if you make a change to that "bit of 
code", you only have to update one copy of it rather than locating and amending every instance.

HTML Forms 
 
So far, The Web Book has been all about publishing information in one di rection, ie from you 
a n d  y o u r  w e b  s i t e  t o  y o u r  v i s i t o r s .   S o m e t i m e s ,  t h o u g h ,  y o u ' l l  w a n t  t o  b e  a b l e  t o  r e q u e s t  
information in the other direction, ie from a visi tor.  This might be a choice of drink from the 
menu in our hotel management system, or someone's name and address in order to add 
them to the subscriber database, or their username and password in order to attempt to log 
them into a protected system. 
 There are two ways of getting information into a PHP program.  One is to use parameters on 
the URL, and retrieve them with $_GET.  The other method, which is much more powerful (and more secure, if done properly) is to use an HTML form. 
 
When we finally start to design database appl ications with PHP, we' ll use forms extensively 
to request information from visitors that ultima tely gets stored in the database.  Therefore, 
you need to familiarise yourself with the cont ents of this chapter before reading further. 
 
A form consists of two main components.  Firs t, one or more input fields into which the 
visitor types or clicks the information you have requested.  Second, a "submit" button which, 
when clicked, sends the contents of the form  to a server-side program for processing in 
whatever way it wishes.  
There's a variety of form field types that you can use, depending on the type of information 
that you're requesting from a visitor.  Here are examples of the ones you'll use most often:

First is a textbox.  This is used for requesting a single line of text.  If you’re using a textbox to 
ask a visitor to enter a password, you can configur e the textbox as a password box.  If you do 
this, characters that the visitor types into the box appear as dots or stars, to stop someone 
looking at the password over the visitor's shoulder.  However, when the submit button is clicked, the real content of the text box (ie, the password as entered) gets sent to the 
receiving program. 
 
Next comes a textarea, which can be as wide an d high as you wish.  You might want to use 
this if you have a feedback form on your si te, into which visitors can type a message. 
 Next, the two sets of opti on boxes.  First, checkboxes.  A set of checkboxes allows the user to 
choose one or more items from a list.  Here, we 're asking him to choose which items he'd like 
for breakfast.  The second set of option boxe s are radio buttons.  These differ from checkboxes because you 
can only choose one option.  In this case, we'r e asking how the visitor would like their eggs 
cooked.  Another common use for radio buttons is to ask a visitor whether they are male or

female.  If you used checkboxes for such a question, a high percentage of people will think it 
amusing to tick both boxes.  But with radio buttons, they can't. 
 Finally, a dropdown box.  From here, a visitor can select an option from a pre-determined 
list.  By holding down the control key in thei r Web browser they can actually select more 
than one item, so long as you perm it this when you create the form. 
 
A dropdown box is a powerful tool, which should  not be underestimated. Where possible, it's 
much better to use a dropdown box than a text  box.  For example, imagine an application 
where you ask someone to enter their favourite make of car.  If you provide a text box, the replies might include "ford", "Ford", "FORD", "F ord I guess" and so on.  If you limit the 
choices by using a dropdown box, you'll end up  with much more consistent data.  Which will 
be extremely helpful when you come to produce a report from your database on the percentage of people who prefer Ford cars. 
Creating a Form with Amaya 
 
Al thou g h you  ca n cre a te a  form  b y ha nd,  typing  the  HT ML  code  into a  te xt e ditor su ch a s 
PSPad, it's easier to use a dedicated HTML ed itor that has form capabilities.  Throughout 
this book we've been using the free Amaya HTML editor, so that’s what we'll use to create a 
form. 
 
To begin creating a form, start Amaya.  From the File menu choose New, and then choose New Document.  Choose a name (form.html will be  fine) and location for the file (your Web 
Work folder is probably easiest location, as we'l l want to upload the form to our server later 
and FileZilla should already be  configured to look there). 
 
Once you've chosen the location and a name, click the Create button. 
 Type "Breakfast Menu" at the top of the page, then press Return a few times to move further 
down the page. Your screen should look like this:

You're  now ready to create the form.    
From the Insert menu, choose the Form option, then choose Insert A Form.  You'll be asked 
to enter details of a form action, but this is so mething we'll cover later so, for the time being, 
just press OK.  
You won't notice anything on the screen, but Amaya has inserted the necessary HTML code 
to create a form.  Click on Views and then Show Source, and you'll see it.  There's not a lot 
there at the moment – just a <form> tag or two.  But that's about to change, as we start to 
add our form fields.  So if you're looking at the source view, return to standard view by 
unticking "Split View horizont ally" from the Views menu.   
 
Let's insert a text box, for our breakfast guest to enter their name.  Type "Name:", which we'll 
use as a label for the textbox.  Then, from the Insert menu, choose Form and then Text Input.   
 
You should see something like this:

 Let's make that text box slightly longer, as it's not quite big enough to hold a name as it 
stands.  Some HTML editors let you drag the box to adjust its size, or right-click it to see a 
menu of things you can change.  But Amaya doesn' t have such a feature, so we'll just have to 
change the HTML code directly .  It's not difficult, and it's a good way to learn anyway. 
 
From the Views menu, click on Show Source.  Locate the HTML tag which says <input 
type="text" /> .  The <input>  tag is how form items such as textboxes and checkboxes 
are created.  The type="text"  part is what makes this a text box.   What's missing is any 
specification for the width of the bo x.  So change the tag to read: 
 
<input type="text" size="40" /> 
 
Click back into the top window and see how the length of the box changes.  If you want to 
make it even longer than 40 characters, feel free.  That's the first half of our simple breakfas t menu form complete.  Now let's add some 
checkboxes and meal items.  At the bottom of your page, type "Please choose your order", to act as a label for the next 
collection of form fields.  On subsequent lines, type some food choices.  In my example I'll 
use eggs, bacon, sausages and beans.    
Then place the cursor next to each food item in turn and, from the Insert menu, choose Form 
and Checkbox.  
 
In a similar way, type a "How do you like your eggs?" label, then some possible choices.  Next 
to each choice, from the Insert me nu, choose Form and then Radio.   
 Finally, we need to add a Submit button otherwis e the user won't be able to make use of the 
f o r m .   S o ,  a t  t h e  b o t t o m  o f  t h e  p a g e ,  a g a i n  from the Insert menu, choose Form and then 
Submit.  
Your screen should now look something like this:

 Incidentally, you might well be wondering why yo ur form looks so, well, messy, and what you 
c a n  d o  a b o u t  i t ?   S p e c i f i c a l l y ,  y ou  p r o b a b l y  wa nt  t o  b e  a b l e  t o  l i n e  u p  t h e  c h e c kb o x e s  a nd radio buttons in a neat vertical column.  The easi est way to do this is to use a table.  For the 
food order checkboxes, for example, create a table with 2 columns and four rows.  Put the 
f o o d  l a b e l s  d o w n  t h e  l e f t  h a n d  c o l u m n  a n d  t h e  c h e c k b o x e s  i n  t h e  r i g h t - h a n d  c e l l s .   T h e n  
everything will line up neatly.  For now, thou gh, we're not too concerned about cosmetics so 
I'll keep things si mple and table-less. 
Naming the Form Objects 
 Having designed a form, there ar e 3 more things you need to do  before it's ready for use.  
These are:  
1. Ensure that each form object is named properly 
2. Add an "action" to the <form> tag 
3. Write some PHP code to handle the submitted forms 
 
We'll go through each of these in order.  
 
First, the naming of form objects (ie, all those checkboxes, textboxes and so on).

When the site visitor presses th e Submit button, the contents of  the form will be sent to a 
PHP program as a series of variables.   The names of those variables will be the names that 
you assign to the objects on the form.  Therefore, it makes sense to ensure that the names 
you choose are sensible.  Obviously, no HTML editor will know in advance what you intend 
to use the contents of, say, a checkbox for.  Some editors, like Dreamweaver, generate names such as "checkbox1" or "radio1", while some, such  as Amaya, don't generate anything at all.  
Either way, you'll definitely want to change the names to something meaningful.  It makes a 
lot more sense for a PHP program to be dealing with a variable called $name or $food rather 
than $checkbox1 or $radio.   
 
So, in Amaya, go to the Views menu and select Show Source.  Start by locating the definition 
of the "name" textbox, which looks like this:  
<input type="text" size="40" /> 
 
There's nothing in that HTML tag which explicitly  says that this is the "name" textbox, but 
you can work it out from various clues, the mo st obvious one being that it comes right after 
the word "Name" which we used as a label.  Welcome to the world of the HTML detective! 
 
Change the line of code to: 
 
<input type="text" name="tb_name" size="40" /> 
 
As you can see, naming a textbox is no more complicated than adding name="whatever"  as 
part of its tag.  Note how I've called it tb_name  to remind me that this data has come from a 
textbox.  This is a useful habit to adopt.  Sometimes it will be helpful to remember what kind 
of data you're dealing with. 
 
The order of the various data items, or parameters, within an HTML tag after input doesn't 
matter.  The line above happens to specify type , then name, then size, but there's no rule 
about which has to come first or last. 
 
Next, we need to name the 4 checkboxes, the code for which currently looks something like:  
Eggs <input type="checkbox" /> 
Bacon <input type="checkbox" /> Sausages <input type="checkbox" /> 
Beans <input type="checkbox" /> 
 
Change the contents of the 4 tags to: 
 
Eggs <input type="checkbox" name="cb_eggs" value="Y" />

Bacon <input type="checkbox" name="cb_bacon" value="Y" /> 
Sausages <input type="checkbox" name="cb_saus" value="Y" /> 
Beans <input type="checkbox" name="cb_beans" value="Y" /> 
 
Checkboxes work in a different way to a textbox.  For each tag, I've specified a name and a 
value.  If the visitor ticks the box, the specified variable name will be set to the specified value.  If the visitor leaves the box unticked, the specified variable will be blank.  So, for 
example, if the visitor ticks the "Bacon" box, $cb_ bacon will be equal to "Y".  If he leaves it 
unticked, $cb_bacon will be blank.  
 
Finally we need to name the radio buttons.  Again, these work in yet another slightly 
different way. 
 
The code for the radio buttons is currently: 
 
Fried <input type="radio" name="radio" /> 
Poached <input type="radio" name="radio" /> 
Scrambled <input type="radio" name="radio" /> 
 
Amaya has given the radio buttons a name, but we're going to change it.  Change the HTML 
tags to: 
 
Fried <input checked type="radio" name="rb_eggs" value="F" /> 
Poached <input type="radio" name="rb_eggs" value="P" /> Scrambled <input type="radio" name="rb_eggs" value="S" /> 
 
A couple of important things to note about these radio buttons.  See how the first radio 
button (fried) includes the word "checked".  This means that, when the form is displayed, 
this is the option that will be selected by default.  You don't have to check any radio button like this but, if you do, make sure you only check one of them. 
 
Next, see how each radio button has the same name (rb_eggs) but a different value (F, P or 
S).  If the visitor clicks the "Fried" button, $rb_eggs will be set to "F".  If he chooses 
"Poached", $rb_eggs will be "P" and so on.    Ea ch "set" of radio buttons on a form, ie each 
collection from which the visito r can make one choice,  needs to  have its own name that is 
shared among all the buttons in the set but which is not used an ywhere else on the form.   
 As to why I've used values of F, P and S rather than "Fried", "Poached" or "Scrambled", this 
i s  m o s t l y  p e r s o n a l  p r e f e r e n c e .   A n d  b e c a u s e  i t  s a v e s  m e  h a v i n g  t o  r e m e m b e r  w h e t h e r  t h e  value of a radio button is Fried or FRIED or fried when I come to check it in the PHP 
program.

With the form fields correctly named, there's just one more thing we need to do before our 
form is ready.  When the visitor fills in the form and clicks the Submit button, the data will 
be sent to a PHP program of our choice.  The name of this PHP program needs to be 
specified in the <form>  tag.  Currently it probably just says: 
 
<form action=""> 
 
You need to change this to: 
 
<form method="POST" action="breakfast.php"> 
 
Now, when the user clicks Submit, the breakfast.php program will be run and the form's data sent to it. 
  
As for method="POST" , this tells the web server how to send the submitted form 
i n f o r m a t i o n .   Y o u  d o n ' t  n e e d  t o  w o r r y  a b o u t  h o w  i t  w o r k s .   J u s t  m a k e  s u r e  t h a t  
method="POST"  appears in every <form> tag that you cr eate.  If you don't, your form won't 
work. 
 
With everything in order, we're now ready to write the breakfast.php program. 
Handling Form Data and Quote Marks 
 
Take a look at the following PHP program.   Note how I've sanitized $name, deleting any 
character that isn't A-Z, a-z or a space.  There's no need to sanitize the other input, as I'm not 
echoing it directly, just comparing it to certain values.   
 
<?php 
$name = $_POST["tb_name"];         # Diner's name $name_san = ereg_replace("[^A-Za-z ]", "", $name); 
 
$cb_eggs = $_POST["cb_eggs"];      # Will be Y if wants eggs 
$cb_bacon = $_POST["cb_bacon"];    # Will be Y if wants bacon 
$cb_sausages = $_POST["cb_saus"];  # Will be Y for sausages 
$cb_beans = $_POST["cb_beans"];    # Will be Y if wants beans $eggs_style = $_POST["rb_eggs"];   # Will be F, P or S 
 
echo "<p>"; echo "Thank you ," . $name_san . "<br><br>"; 
 
echo "Your breakfast order is:<br><br>";

If ($cb_beans == "Y")  
{ echo "beans<br>"; 
} 
 If ($cb_bacon == "Y")  
{ 
echo "bacon<br>"; } 
 
If ($cb_sausages == "Y")  { 
echo "sausages<br>"; 
}  
If ($cb_eggs == "Y") 
{ If ($eggs_style == "F")  { echo "Fried eggs<br><br>"; } 
If ($eggs_style == "P")  { echo "Poached eggs<br><br>"; } 
If ($eggs_style == "S")  { echo "Scrambled eggs<br><br>"; } } 
 
echo "</p>";  
?> 
 
One thing you'll not have seen before is the us e of a hash (#) symbol to signify the start of a 
comment.  Also, note how we retrieve each form variable with $_POST["something"] .   
 There are two ways that data gets sent to PH P programs.  One is via the URL, such as 
 
www.yoursite.com/breakfast.php?meal=breakfast&eggs=fried  
 
In this case, the PHP program must retrieve th e data with $_GET.  But if the data comes 
from a form, as it does here, you need to use $_POST instead. And yes, that's why we added 
method="POST"  to the form tag. 
 Don't try changing to method="get"  in your form tag, by the way, and then using $_GET to 
retrieve the contents of the form.  It will work , sometimes, but the contents of the form will 
appear in the URL.  There are serious security implicatio ns in doing this.

Note how I've generated <p> tags around the output, so that the page will neatly adopt the 
layout as specified in the <p> tag style for whatever css style sh eet you decide to use.  To do 
so, you'll need to add another set of "echo" statements which generate <head> and <body> 
sections, and a link to the style sheet.  The link should go in the head section and looks like: 
 
<LINK href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> 
 
However, if you're going to gene rate this line with some PHP, note that the following won't 
work: 
 
echo "<LINK href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">"; 
 
The problem is that the quote marks (") are being used here for 2 different purposes.  The 
very first one and the very last one are part of the PHP code, and specify the start and end of 
the text you're outputting to the visitor's web browser.  The others, though, are part of the 
text being output. 
 
When you want to echo a literal quote to the vi sitor's browser, the rule is that you need to 
precede it with a backslash.  Like this: 
 
echo "<LINK href=\"style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">"; 
 Note, too, how I've used a different layout for so me of the if… statements.  If the visitor wants 
eggs, I've then tested for the type of eggs using a form that takes just one line for the 
comparison and the display of the message.  This is useful if the amount of code you want to 
run as a result of the test is short, and keeps things neater. 
Testing The Form 
 Type or paste the PHP program above into a file called breakfast.php.  Upload this to your 
web server, along with the form.html file (or whatever you called it).  Make sure that both files get uploaded into the same folder on the server, and that the name of the PHP file is the same one specified in the "action" part of th e  f o r m  t a g .   O n  s o m e  s e r v e r s  t h i s  i s  c a s e -
sensitive, so breakfast.php is not the same as BREAKFAST.PHP. 
 With both files uploaded, surf to the page that contains your form and you should see this:

Check that you can type into the Name box, an d that you can select an assortment of food 
items and a single egg type.  Fill in the form as  you wish, then click Submit.  With luck, you 
should see something like this:

It works.  The data from the form has been transferred to our breakfast.php program, and 
has been processed and displayed correctly. Plus, because form input is being sanitized, this 
program is also writte n in a secure way. 
 
Being able to create forms, and write PHP prog rams to deal with the data from them, is a 
vital part of developing PHP- based web applications.  Only by using forms can you request 
information from visitors to your site. 
 
One of the most useful things about forms is that you can populate them from a database 
automatically, and this is something we'll cover in more detail later.  But imagine, for 
example, that the list of breakfast items (eggs, bacon etc) is held in a database table.  Having 
accessed the database and retrieved the list of items, you then wish to present them in a menu for the user to choose. 
 
Here's the code we originally used, in form.html, to create the menu:  
Eggs <input type="checkbox" name="cb_eggs" value="Y" /> 
Bacon <input type="checkbox" name="cb_bacon" value="Y" /> Sausages <input type="checkbox" name="cb_saus" value="Y" /> 
Beans <input type="checkbox" name="cb_beans" value="Y" /> 
 
And here's a PHP version of it, based on an a r r a y  o f  i t e m s  t h a t  w e  h a v e  r e a d  f r o m  t h e  
database.    
<?php 
for ($i = 0; $i <= count($items); $i++) 
{ 
echo $items[$i]; echo "<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"cb_" ; 
echo $items[$i]  . "\" value=\"Y\" />"; 
} ?> 
 
For an array called $items[] that contains valu es of "bacon", "sausage" and "beans", this code 
will produce: 
 
<input type="checkbox" name="cb_bacon" value="Y" /> 
<input type="checkbox" name="cb_sausage" value="Y" /> 
<input type="checkbox" name="cb_beans" value="Y" />

Hey presto, a dynamically-created collection of ch eckboxes.  Now, hopefully, you can start to 
see how PHP and MySQL work together to allow you to create powerful web-based 
applications.  And you're probably  itching to get to the database stuff.  Don't worry, not long 
now. 
 
Note how I've preceded quotation marks with a backslash when I want to echo them to the visitor's browser, ie when they're not part of th e PHP code itself.  This was discussed in more 
detail on page 246. 
Retrieving Textarea and Dropdown Data 
 So far, I've shown you how to retrieve the cont ents of a textbox, checkbox and radio button 
using PHP.   For completeness, it's worth explai ning how to retrieve the value of a textarea 
and a dropdown too.  
A textarea's content is retrieved in the same way as a textbox.  Just use $_POST["xyz"] , 
where xyz is the name of the textarea as defined in the form.  Remember, though, that it may 
contain carriage return characters if the user pressed Return while entering the contents of 
the textarea.  Carriage returns are harmless from a security perspective, but if you don't want 
them you can remove them with the same type of ereg_replace command used for sanitizing.  
The ereg code for a carriage return character is \r although it's often also followed by a "line 
feed" character ( \n) as well.  So you need to search for \n and \r and delete them both. 
 
As for a dropdown box, this too is easy to retrieve.  Just use $_POST[]  with the name of the 
dropbox as specified in the form. For example, here's the HTML code for a simple dropdown 
box.  As you can see, it is created by a <select>  tag, though few people ever refer to it as a 
select box: 
 
<select name="dd_season"> 
<option>Spring</option> 
<option>Summer</option> 
<option>Autumn</option> <option>Winter</option> 
</select> 
 
This produces, on a form, the following:

Using $_POST["dd_season"]  in PHP will return the name of a season. However, there's 
another option that you may find useful.  Consider this: 
 
<select name="dd_season"> 
<option value="1">Spring</option> <option value="2">Summer</option> 
<option value="3">Autumn</option> 
<option value="4">Winter</option> </select> 
 
Now, the values that $_POST[]  will return are no longer Spring, Summer, Autumn or 
Winter.  Instead, the values returned will be 1, 2, 3 or 4 respectively. 
 
Imagine you're populating a form  from a database, as described above.  You want to produce 
a drop-down list of all the guests who are currently staying in the hotel.  So you retrieve, 
from the database, their id number and their name.  Where I've listed the names of the 
seasons above, you display the guest's name.  But where I've shown 1,2,3,4 above, you echo 
the guest id number.  Now, when the hotel receptionist chooses a particular name from the 
drop-down list, the PHP code knows the guest's data base id number rather than their name.    
Consider this while re-reading the se ction on database normalization (page 183) to see just 
how incredibly useful this is. 
Checkbox Arrays 
 
When you're creating HTML forms, you'll ofte n find yourself creating a large set of  
checkboxes.  For example, keeping with th e hotel management syst em analogy for the 
moment, perhaps you want to show a screen which lists each bedroom by number, along 
with a checkbox, so that the op erator of the system can choose which rooms to mark as being 
in need of cleaning. 
 
One way is to do something like this:  
Room 1 <input type="checkbox" name="room1" value="Y" /> <br> 
Room 2 <input type="checkbox" name="room2" value="Y" /> <br> Room 3 <input type="checkbox" name="room3" value="Y" /> <br> 
Room 4 <input type="checkbox" name="room4" value="Y" /> <br> 
 
Which would work, of course, but will cause problems when the PHP code on the receiving 
end of the checkboxes needs to do its stuff.  There might be dozens of checkbox variables to, 
er, check, each with a different yet slightly-sim ilar name.  There's no easy way to use a loop

and quickly scan through the values of $r oom1, $room2, $room3 and $room4 to find out 
which are blank and which are "Y". 
 As you might expect, there's a handy shortcut, an d that's to create an array of checkboxes.  
You'll remember the concept of PHP arrays from page 229.  Here's a version of the above 
HTML code that uses a checkbox array:  
Room 1 <input type="checkbox" name="rooms[]" value="1" /> <br> 
Room 2 <input type="checkbox" name="rooms[]" value="2" /> <br> Room 3 <input type="checkbox" name="rooms[]" value="3" /> <br> 
Room 4 <input type="checkbox" name="rooms[]" value="4" /> <br> 
 
Note that each checkbox now has the same na me, which ends with 2 empty square brackets.  
Note too, that each checkbox has a unique value which corresponds to the room number.  
The above HTML displays the following, when included in a form:  
 
 When the contents of the checkboxes is sent to the PHP code, the results will be in an array 
called $rooms.  This array will contain only  those checkboxes that were ticked (there's no 
way to retrieve a list of those that were not, which is sometimes annoying).  The values in the 
array will be the same as the value= settings for those checkboxes.  So, for example, if the 
visitor ticks boxes 2 and 4, the $rooms array will contain 2 elements (numbered 0 and 1, 
because arrays always start at 0).  $rooms[0] will contain 2 (the first room selected) and 
$rooms[1] will contain 4. 
 
Here's some PHP code to handle the above HTML. It steps through each of the entries in the 
$rooms array and displays the value: 
 
$rooms = $_POST["rooms"]; 
$room_count = count($rooms); 
echo "There were " . $room_count . " rooms chosen.<br>"; 
echo "The rooms you ticked were:<br>"; echo "<br>"; 
for ($i=0; $i <= count($rooms); $i++) 
{ echo $rooms[$i] . "<br>"; 
}

Perhaps the classic use for an HTML form, outside of somethin g that displays information 
from a database, is the feedback form.  This is a great way to allow site visitors to send you a 
message.  
Just create a form on a web page which cont ains a textbox for the visitor's name, and a 
textarea into which they can enter a brief message.  When they click Submit, your PHP 
program retrieves the sender's name from the textbox and the message from the textarea.  It 
can then use the mail() function in PHP to send  the contents of the textarea to your email 
address, after adding the contents of th e textbox to the start of the message. 
 
I won't include an example of how to do this, as  all of the required steps have already been 
covered in this book.  Just use $_POST to retrieve the two items of text, and the mail 
function (see page 221) to send it. 
 
If you want to allow visitors to your site to send you comm ents, suggestions etc, then a 
feedback form is the best way to do it.  The only other option is to include your email address 
on a web page, perhaps as a hyperlink.  If yo u do this, however, you have no control over 
what happens when the visitor clicks on that li nk.  Most often, the vi sitor's computer will 
launch its standard email program (whatever that  is set to).  Assuming there is one, of 
course, otherwise nothing will happen at all.  Very messy and unprofessional.  By having a 
feedback form, you never have to divulge your em ail address in public.  The visitor fills in the 
form, clicks Submit, and your PHP code sends you the message. 
Hidden Fields 
 
A form is a great way to pass information back to a PHP program from a web page.  
Sometimes, though, you might want to include ot her information in addition to the contents

of the form fields.  As it happens, one excellent use of this feature is to help spam-proof a 
feedback form. 
 Consider the case of the feedback form as mentioned above.  It provides an easy way for 
anyone to type in a message, click Submit, an d have it mailed to you.  The trouble is, 
spammers often use these forms as a way to send  unwanted mail.  If the form merely sends 
its contents to you alone, it's inconvenient.  If the form posts its contents to your company's 
o n l i n e  f o r u m ,  i t ' s  a  m u c h  b i g g e r  p r o b l e m .   S o  h e r e ' s  a  ne a t  w a y  t o  c re a t e  a  f e e d b a c k  f o r m  
that's virtually spammer-proof.  
 
A l m o s t  a l l  f o r m - b a s e d  s p a m  i s  s e n t  b y  a u t o m a t e d  p r o g r a m s  r a t h e r  t h a n  h u m a n s .   T h e  
programs surf to your feedback form page, pa ste some text into it, and click the submit 
button.  All within a very short time.  And that 's their downfall.  Spam is only worth sending 
if you can do it quickly, in order to be able to  send sufficient quantities.  Real people, on the 
other hand, type relatively slow ly.  It probably takes them at least 15 seconds, after the 
feedback form is displayed, before they click Submit. 
 
So is there a way of finding out how long the user took to fill in the form?  If so, we can simply discard the contents of any form that gets submitted too quickly, rather than emailing 
its contents to anywhere.  The answer is to use something called a hidden form field.  You're probably accustomed to 
seeing something like this in the HTML code of a form: 
 
<input type="text" size="40" /> 
 
Now consider this: 
 
<input type="hidden" name="timecode" value="12345" /> 
 
This creates another form variable called $timecode , with a value of "12345", which will be 
sent back to the PHP program when the form is submitted.  It doesn't correspond to any 
form item like a textbox or checkbox,  but is what's known as a hidden field.  Hidden because it doesn't appear anywhere on the form.  If you ever want to send other information back to 
the PHP program, hidden fields are the way to do it.  And one of those is the key to our 
spam-proofing.  
In the HTML file that creates the feedback form, add a few lines of PHP as follows, before the 
end of the form (ie, before the </form> tag):  
<?php 
$t = time();

echo "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"timecode\" value=\"" . $t . "\" />"; 
?> 
 
PHP's time() function returns a long number (10 digits or so) which corresponds to the 
number of seconds since January 1st 1970.  It's known as the timestamp, and is often used in 
programming to find out the current time or to do time-based calculations.  For example, if 
you want to know what the time is going to be  in 2 hours, make a call to time(), then add 
7200 to the result (3600 seconds in an ho ur, times 2), then call one of the many PHP 
functions that convert a timestamp back to a date and time.

called $timecode that contains the timestamp at  which the form was disp layed to the visitor. 
 
When your PHP code receives the data from the form, make a call to time() and compare the 
value to $timecode by subtracting one from the other.  The result will be the number of seconds that elapsed between the form being se nt to the visitor's browser and the Submit

Accessing MySQL Databases with PHP 
 
On page 190 we covered the basics of creating a we b-based MySQL database and querying it 
via phpMyAdmin.  On page 208 we covered writing programs  using PHP.  And on page 239 
we covered HTML forms.  Once you know how to do these three things (and if you have 
forgotten, you would be advised to recap before going further), we can now put it all together 
and create an online database application.   
 
To continue, you will need to ensure that the hms database we  discussed on page 187 exists 
on the web server, and that there’s a table within it called customers.  The customers table 
needs 7 fields: 
 id 
firstname 
surname title 
address 
phone email 
   
All of these should be text fields (tinytext sh ould suffice) except id, which should be an 
integer.   Further, id should be set as an auto-increment field.  If you’ve forgotten how to do 
so, refer back to page 190 for coverage of phpMyAdmin. 
 
With the database and table created, your phpM yAdmin screen should look like this when 
you view the structure of the Customers table:

You’ll also need some data in the table.  Hopefully, your data will still be there from when we 
covered phpMyAdmin.  If not, browse to the Cu stomers table, click on Insert, and create a 
couple of records.  Now, when you click on Br owse, you should see the data in the table like

Counting Rows 
 
Now we’re ready to start writing some real code.  Close your Web browser, open PSPad, and create a file in your public_html folder call ed custlist.php which contains the following: 
 
<?php 
 
$db_host = "localhost"; 
$db_database = "thewebbo_hms"; $db_username = "thewebbo"; 
$db_password = "abc123xyz"; 
$dbcnx = mysql_connect($db_host,$db_username,$db_password); mysql_select_db($db_database); 
 
$query = "select id from customers"; $q = mysql_query($query); 
$total = mysql_num_rows($q); 
 echo "Total number of customers in the database is " . $total;

Open your web browser and surf to www.yoursite.com/custlist.php  and you should 
see the following: 
 
 
 For simplicity, I haven’t generated <HTML>, <b ody> and <p> tags.  Technically, therefore, 
the HTML page is not valid code.  However, it  keeps things simple for now, and just about 
every browser will allow it.  When you come to develop real applications, make sure that you 
generate valid HTML pages which contain all the necessary tags. 
 
Let’s look at this  code in detail. 
 
The first 6 lines are used to connect to your database.  You need to ensure that these lines are 
present at the start of every PHP program you wr ite, if you intend to access a database.  The 
first 4 lines are where you specify the host name, database name, username and password 
(use the same password and username that yo u use for accessing phpMyAdmin or your web 
hosting control panel).  The hostname will prob ably be “localhost” unless your web hosting 
provider stores its databases on a server other than the web server.  If this is the case, you

will be advised accordingly.  Make sure you ch ange the database info rmation accordingly.  
Don't simply copy and paste my example in to your programs, as this won't work. 
 
Having made the connection to our database, we can now access it.  This takes just 4 lines of 
code, as follows. 
 
$query = "select id from customers"; 
This creates our MySQL query (you should recall these from when we queried the database 
directly with phpMyAdmin).  We store the text of the query in a variable called $query.  In this example, we want to select all the id values from the customers table. 
 
$q = mysql_query($query); Now we execute the actual query.  The  mysql_query function performs the query, which 
we have previously stored in the $query variable.  Note how we assign the result of the query to the $q variable.  
$total = mysql_num_rows($q); 
Having performed the query, we now use the mysql_num_rows() function, which returns 
the total number of database reco rds (ie, rows) which were returned  in the $q query.  That is, 
the total number of id values.  At this point we haven’t actually retrieved any data.  All we 
have is the total number of rows.  Which is all we need right now,  so let’s display it: 
 
echo "Total number of customers in the database is " . $total; 
Reading Data 
 
We now have a complete PHP program which can access a MySQL database.  So let’s adapt it 
to display some real data.  Change the program to the following: 
 
<?php 
 
$db_host = "localhost"; $db_database = "thewebbo_hms"; 
$db_username = "thewebbo"; 
$db_password = "xyzabc123"; 
$dbcnx = mysql_connect($db_host,$db_username,$db_password); 
mysql_select_db($db_database); 
 $query = "select firstname,surname from customers"; 
$q = mysql_query($query);

echo "These are the customers on file:<br><br>"; 
 
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($q)) { 
echo $row["firstname"]; 
echo " "; echo $row["surname"]; 
echo "<br>"; 
}  
?> 
 
As before, we start with the standard 6 lines for connecting to our database.  Then we create 
a database query ( select firstname, surname from customers ) and execute it.  
Note how we specify which fields we need.  In theory you can just say select * from 
customers , which would return all 7 fields.  But it’s good practice to only request fields that 
you’re actually going to use.  It re duces the load on the database server. 
 
When you perform a query that returns data, as we have just done, you then need to loop 
through the array of rows that the query returns.  That’s what the mysql_fetch_array  
code does:  
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($q)) 
{ echo $row["firstname"]; 
echo " "; 
echo $row["surname"]; echo "<br>"; 
} 
 
Here, we use a while…  loop, which returns an array of fields called $row[] for each row of 
the database returned by the query.  The names in square brackets match the field names in 
the table.  So in this example, for each matching row, we echo the row’s firstname field, then a space, then the row’s surname field, then a line break.  This produces a neat listing of every 
customer’s full name. 
 You don't have to use $row as the array name, of course.  You could call it $record, 
$customer, or whatever else you choose.  Bu t many PHP programmers tend to call it $row, 
so that's what I use.   
 
Try adapting this program so that it also prin ts out the customer’s em ail address.  Remember 
to adjust the database query so that it  returns 3 fields rather than just 2.

Also, try changing the query to: 
 
select firstname,surname from customers where id=3 
 
This time, notice how just one matching row ge ts returned.  Remember that id is a numeric 
field, so there's no need for quotes round the number 3. 
  
Let's neaten up the output slightly by using a table.  Here's a new version of the program.  
Again, I've kept the HTML tags to a bare minimum in order to make the listing as short as 
possible for clarity.  When you do this for real , you must include HTML and body tags.  Plus, 
you'll probably want to create  a style sheet th at specifies the design of <p> or <td> tags. 
 
<?php 
 $db_host = "localhost"; 
$db_database = "thewebbo_hms"; 
$db_username = "thewebbo"; $db_password = "xxxx"; 
$dbcnx = mysql_connect($db_host,$db_username,$db_password); 
mysql_select_db($db_database);  
$query = "select firstname,surname from customers"; 
$q = mysql_query($query);  
echo "<table border=1>"; 
 
echo "<tr>"; 
echo "<th colspan=\"2\">These are the customers on file</th>"; 
echo "</tr>";  
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($q)) 
{ echo "<tr>"; 
echo "<td>" . $row["firstname"] . "</td>"; 
echo "<td>" . $row["surname"] . "</td>"; echo "</tr>"; 
} 
 echo "</table>";

This time, we start by creating a table and sett ing a border width.  There are lots of other 
useful options that you can add to the table tag, or specify with a css style, but this will do for 
now.  Next, we create a table header row.  Note the use of colspan, to indicate that this row 
spans both columns of the tabl e.  And see how I've used a th tag for the header row cell, 
rather than the standard td tag in every other row. This will allow me to specify a different 
design for the header row when I ge t around to creating the css file. 
 
Finally, within the while… loop that brings in each row of data from the table, I create an 
HTML table row. 
 
The end result is:  
 
 
Not particularly pretty, but all of the building bloc ks are there.  All that remains is to create a 
css file which contains entries for the p, th and td tags, and generate another line of HTML 
which attaches it.  I shall leave this to you.  One of the great things about CSS is that you can 
design the structure of your site independently from its look.  Once the PHP code is working, 
and returning the information you need, then you can work on the css to make it look pretty. 
So long as the PHP code simply generates tags such as th, td and p , you can then control the 
appearance of your site via a css file wi thout needing amend the PHP code at all. 
 
Before we leave the topic of reading data, here's one more neat example. 
 
<?php 
 
$db_host = "localhost"; 
$db_database = "thewebbo_hms"; $db_username = "thewebbo"; 
$db_password = "xyzxyz"; 
$dbcnx = mysql_connect($db_host,$db_username,$db_password); mysql_select_db($db_database);

$query = "select firstname,surname,phone from customers"; 
$q = mysql_query($query);  
echo "<table border=1>"; 
 echo "<tr>"; 
echo "<td colspan=\"2\">These are the customers on file.</td>"; 
echo "</tr>";  
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($q)) 
{ echo "<tr>"; 
echo "<td title=\"" . $row["phone"] . "\">"; 
echo  $row["firstname"] . "</td>"; echo "<td>" . $row["surname"] . "</td>"; 
echo "</tr>"; 
}  
echo "</table>"; 
 ?> 
 
It's only a couple of minor changes to the code.  First, I've amended the query to return the phone number field as well as firstname and surname.  Then, when I create the table row 
that contains the first name of the customer, I also add a "title" to the td tag, the contents of 
which is the phone number field.   
 
For example, the generated HTML  code for John Smith with a phone number of 1234 would 
be: 
 
<td title="1234">John</td><td>Smith</td> 
 
The "title" parameter in a td tag creates pop-up text whic h appears when you hover your 
mouse over the cell.  So now, just hover the mouse over someone's first name and their 
phone number magically appears.  Like this:

Searching A Table 
 
Now we'll write a simple PHP application that allows the user of th e site to search the 
customer database for a specific surname.  This is the sort of thing that a hotel receptionist 
might do if they're using the Hotel Mana gement System that we're developing. 
 
Before you go any further, you need to use phpM yAdmin to ensure that at least 2 records in 
the customer database share at least 2 consecutive letters.  This is because we want to add a 
partial search facility, and it won't work if there's no matching data to return. 
 
As you can see from the screen shot below, we have 2 customers with surnames of Allen and 
Albert.  We should then be able to search on a partial match of "Al" and return both names.

With the necessary test data in place, we can pu t the application together.  Before we look at 
the code, here's the app in action.  First, the search form: 
 
 
 
We fill in a surname, choose Full or Partial se arch, and click the button.  In this instance, 
John Smith's details are displayed:

Now let's try a partial search.  We'll search for "Al" and select the relevant radio button.  As 
expected, both of the matching records are returned:  
 
 
To show how this all works, here's the complete PHP code for the application: 
 
<?php 
 
# Start the page properly echo "<HTML>"; 
echo "<body>"; 
 # Check whether the searchtype radio button has been set 
 
# If not set, display the search form.  if (!isset($_POST["searchtype"])) 
{ 
echo "<form method=\"POST\" action=\"search.php\">"; echo "Search for surname:<br>"; 
echo "<input type=\"text\" name=\"searchtext\" size=\"15\">";

If you've been reading throug h this book in sequence, then hopefully you'll be able to 
understand most of the above.  Here are some points to help you. 
  
• The program displays one of two web pages.  The first time around, it displays the 
s e a r c h  f o r m  w h i c h ,  w h e n  s u b m i t t e d ,  l a u n c h e s  t h e  s a m e  p h p  p r o g r a m  a g a i n .   T h e  form contains a textbox called searchte xt, and a pair of radio buttons called 
searchtype with possibl e values of FULL or PARTIAL.  If the searchtype has been set 
(to either PARTIAL or to FULL) at the star t of the program, this indicates that the 
form has been submitted, so, rather than displaying the form again, we do the actual 
search instead. 
• I've created a function called sanitize_form_ text, which is listed at the bottom of the 
program.  At the point where the value of the search text is retrie ved from the form, it 
then gets sanitized.

•  Depending on the value of the radio button, we then execute one of 2 MySQL 
database queries.  For the full search, ie where we only return complete matches, the 
query boils down to: 
 
select firstname,surname from customers where surname='xyz' 
 
where xyz is the search text entered in the form.  Because surname is a text field, you 
need quotes round the item you're searching for.  Using single quotes is easiest, 
because they don't conflict with  the double quotes that make up part of the PHP code.   
 
The MySQL query for the partial search ends with: 
 
…from customers where surname LIKE '%xyz%' 
 
LIKE %xyz% will match surnames which contain xyz anywhere within them. 
 
Remember that a MySQL query wi ll return the data in a rand om order unless you specify 
otherwise.  So if you want the re sults sorted by surname, say, add order by surname  to 
the end of the query.   
Preventing SQL Injection Attacks 
This section is vitally important.  Please read it carefully. 
 Although writing web-based databa se applications such as this one isn't particularly difficult 
to do, it's vital that you pay careful attention to security.  Hackers love nothing more than trying to find ways to steal, delete or corrupt the contents of MySQL database tables.  And sadly, it's a lot easier than you might imagine. 
 Take the example above, where we allow the site visitor to enter some search text, and we then pass the result of that search text to a da tabase query.  If the vi sitor enters some search 
text of Smith, then our query ends up as:  
select firstname,surname from customers where surname='Smith' 
 
No problem there.   But what if the visi tor enters some search text as follows: 
 
Smith' or surname != 'Smith 
 
This might look weird at first.  But paste it into the query above, in place of the "permitted" 
surname, and you end up  with the following:

select firstname,surname from customers where surname='Smith' or 
surname != 'Smith' 
 
The != symbol means "not equal to".  So now we have a query which returns every record 
from the table where surname is Smith or where surname is not Smith.  In other words, it 
will return the entire contents of the table!  Imagine a guest being able to display every 
customer's record in addition to their own.  Or a secure login facility where the visitor is only 
granted access " if the password is correct or  the password is not correct ".  
 
Here's another example.  Consider what happens  if the following is entered as a surname: 
 
Smith' or surname != 'Smith; delete from customers 
 
The semicolon is the standard character in My SQL for separating multiple commands on a 
single line.  So now, after your program se arches for the entered surname, it will then delete 
the entire contents of your customer database!  
 
By preventing unwanted characters from being passed to the MySQL query, we prevent SQL injection attacks.  So, this need s to be your golden rule when writing database applications: if 
you are going to use untrusted data as part of a query, sanitize that data first.  At the very 
least, do not allow symbols such as < > ! '; and so on.  Ideally, allow only letters and numbers, plus anything else that is specifically required.  For example, if you're asking 
someone for their email address you'll need to  allow a dot, dash, underscore and the "@" 
symbol. 
 
Do not underestimate the importance of protecti ng against injection at tacks on your system.  
Hackers have sophisticated tools that automatica lly look for such errors on web sites and try 
to exploit them.   Therefore, always sanitize yo ur text first, and always use the _san version 
within a query.   
 Remember, too, that you should only allow the characters that you actually need.  Otherwise, 
you risk inadvertently allowing characters whic h can lead to problems.  For example, %3B is 
the hex code for a semicolon so, if you block the user from entering semicolons, they can still 
delete your customer database by using %3B instead.  The cure? Bl ock the % symbol too. 
Adding Data to a Table 
 Now that we can read and search a MySQL table, it's about time that we added the ability to 
store new data records too.  This will allow us to stop using phpMyAdmin to insert data, as 
we'll be able to use our own program instead.

Let's write a little application that allows us  to create a new customer in the existing 
customers table.  We'll start by displaying a form with space for the 6 fields (firstname, 
surname, title, address, phone and email).  Then, when the user presses the Submit button, 
we'll add the contents of those fields into a new database record (or, to use the correct 
terminology, into a new table row).  We'll also need to create a new id, of course.  However, MySQL will take care of that automatically, as the id field is se t to auto_increment. 
 
Here's the application in action.  First, the data entry form: 
 
 
 Having filled in the form, I click the button and see the following:

Neat.  Not only has the data from the form been inserted, but we also know the id that was 
generated for the auto_increment id field.   Just  to make sure it really did work, let's  pop 
into phpMyAdmin and check that a new cust omer record has indeed been created: 
 
 
 
Excellent, although there’s one minor bug immediately apparent.  The spaces and carriage return characters have been stripped out of  the address, which has been stored as 
65TheStreetLondon.  Can you work out why, and what needs to be done in order to fix this? 
 One other point worthy of mention here.  Why do the id’s go 1, 2, 3, 14 instead of 1,2,3,4?

While I was writing and debugging the addcus t.php program that you're about to see, 
records with ids from 4 to 13 were created.  I subsequently used phpM yAdmin to delete those 
records.  And yet, next time MySQL auto-generated an id, it used 14 rather than going back 
to 4. 
 There’s no rule as to how auto-increment fields are generated.  All that you’re guaranteed is 
that they will be unique, ie that there won’t be  two customers with the same id.  You certainly 
should never assume that they will be consecutiv e.  So, for example, attempting to count the 
number of customers in the table by looking for the one with the highest-numbered id simply 
will not be reliable. 
 Here's the full PHP code for the addcust.php application: 
 
<?php 
 
# ADDCUST.PHP - Add a new customer to the customers table 
 # Check whether there's a surname specified.  
# If not, then just display the form. 
 if (!isset($_POST["tb_surname"])) # if no surname specified 
{

Almost everything should be familiar here, as the structure is very similar to the previous 
search example.  The most important new feature is the way we insert a new row into a table.  
Once you’re connected to the databa se, the syntax of the MySQL query is: 
 
insert into table (field1,field2) values (‘value1’,’value2’) 
 
We then embed it into a PHP  mysql_query function call.  In the above example, I’ve built 
up the query string over 4 lines.  This is pure ly for clarity, including the way that the listing 
looks when printed.  You don’t have to do it like that if you don’t want to. 
 
The two sets of items in brackets correspond to  the field names you want to insert, and the 
values for them.  You don’t need to specify every field – if you don’t, ones you omit will be

left blank unless you specified a default value when you created the table initially.  Note that 
we didn’t bother specifying a value for the id field – this was generated automatically because 
it’s set to auto_increment.  Also note the si ngle quote marks around the values, which are 
required if you’re inserting data into a text field as opposed to a numeric one.   
 
There’s a handy PHP function called mysql_insert_id() , which returns the value of the 
last auto_increment that MySQL generated.  Afte r inserting the record, we call this function 
in order to find the value, and then we displa y it.  You might want to adapt the program so 
that, once the row has been inserted, you then re trieve it from the data base and display all of 
the new customer’s data for verification.  Know ing the id makes this easy – you can just do 
something like: 
 
$new_id = mysql_insert_id(); 
$query =  “select * from customers where id=$new_id”; 
$q = mysql_query($query); 
 
If you are executing a MySQL query which you know will only be returning precisely one 
record (not zero, and not more than one), you don’t need a while… loop in order to skip through the results.  Inst ead, you can simply do: 
 
$row = mysql_fetch_array($q); 
echo $row[“firstaname”]; 
echo $row[“surname”]; 
 
and so on.  There is only ever going to be one array to fetch, so a loop is unnecessary. 
 
It’s worth pointing out that I didn’t generate all of the HTML code for the data entry form by 
hand.  I used a separate HTML editor.   Once I’d designed the form and it looked the way I 
wanted it, I then copied the code into the PHP file and added the echo statements around it, 
as well as changing all the HTML double quote marks to \” in order to distinguish them 
from the ones that are part of the PHP code.  Using an HTML editor to mock up page which 
then become PHP programs is common practice among developers.  Don’t assume that you 
have to write all your HTML by hand. 
Editing a Data Record 
 
So far, we've covered reading data from a table, searching a table, and adding new records.  
Next, you'll need to know how to edit an existing record.  Just as with using SELECT FROM  
to read data and INSERT INTO  to create new records, existing a record is just as easy.  It's 
simply a matter of knowing how to use an UPDATE…SET  query.

A typical edit might be: 
 
update customers set phone='1234' where id=25 
 
This sets the phone number field to '1234' for the customer whose id is 25. 
 Another example might be the case of Jane Alle n who calls to say that she's recently married 
and her surname is now Chambers.  To update her entry in the database, you would probably 
use: 
 
update customers set surname='Chambers' where surname='Allen' 
 
Which, at first glance, might appear to be sensible.  It would certainly work, in that it would 
change Jane Allen to Jane Chambers.  Trouble is, it'll change the surname of every 'Allen' in 
the customers table, and not just Jane.  One solution is to do the following instead: 
 
update customers set surname='Chambers' where surname='Allen' and 
firstname='Jane' 
 
This will probably work.  But again, there might be more than one Jane Allen in the 
database, so we need a more  robust, reliable solution. 
 
You will recall that we designed our database table so that every entry, ie every row, has a 
unique id number.  Being able to  address a particular row by its id is very useful, especially 
when you're editing or deleting a row and you need to be sure that you're addressing the 
right one.  
Here's how I've chosen to design my editcust.php application.  First, we display a list of every 
customer's firstname and surname, along with a radio button like this:

The user chooses a name to edit (Robert Schifreen in this case), clicks the button and is 
presented with the customer's details in a pre-filled form:

Once again, this example is arranged in a single file (editcust.php) and all in PHP mode (ie, 
without flipping back into HTML mode).  Re membering that the Web is a stateless system, 
where each page has no idea what came before it, I have used a parameter on the URL to maintain state.  You can read  more about this on page 295. 
 
The program starts by performing the necessary co de to connect to the  database, as this will 
be needed regardless.  Then, we use $_GET["action"]  to retrieve the value of the "action" 
parameter from the URL which tells us what to do  next.   The first time around, this is not 
present and so we show the home page of the system, ie the screen from which the user can 
select a customer to edit.  
We build the selection form dynamically from the database, producing a table where each 
row contains a customer name and a radio button.  The name of the radio button is id2edit.  
The value of each radio button is the database id number of the customer.  This is standard 
practice, and a very common way of using radi o buttons (or dropdown boxes) to select a 
database record.  By setting the radio button va lue to a database id, the code which receives 
our chosen name knows pr ecisely which customer record we want to edit. 
 
The "action" for the form is set to editcust.php?action=show_record .  This means 
that the PHP program will be called again when the form is submitted.  But this time, 
$_GET["action"]  will be equal to show_record  and so a different function will be 
performed. 
 
When we detect that $_GET["action"]  is "show_record", we know that we need to display 
the customer record form and that we also need to pre-load it with the data for the specified 
customer.   
 
First, we use $_POST  to retrieve the value of the id2edit radio button in the previous form.  
We now know which database record the user wa nts to edit.  So, having already connected to 
the database at the start of the program, we retrieve that user's details (name, address, 
phone, email, title) into a $row array.  Then we create a customer record form, just as we did in the previous addcust.php example for creating a new customer.  The only difference is 
that, in addition to displaying each form field (textbox or textarea), we also generate HTML 
which fills in the contents of that fi eld for the user of the site to edit. 
 
Some example HTML code for displaying  a text box plus some content is: 
 
<input type="text" name="firstname" value="Robert" size="25">

As you can see, the value= component allows you to pre-fill the text box with whatever 
c o n t e n t  y o u  w a n t .   S o  i n  t h i s  c a s e  w e  d o  j u s t  t h a t ,  b u t  w e  f i l l  i t  w i t h  s o m e  t e x t  t h a t  w a s  
retrieved from the database.  
The HTML code to pre-fill a textarea is slightly different.  It looks like this: 
 
<textarea rows="2" name="address"> 
123 Farm Road, London W8 
</textarea> 
 
The action for this editing form is set to editcust.php?action=store_record .  So 
once again, when the edit has been made and the user presses the Save button, this PHP program will be called one more time.  This time, when we discover that $action is "store_record", we retrieve the edited values from the form and update the database 
accordingly. 
 One thing to note is the hidden field in the sh ow_record form.  In addition to pre-populating 
the form with the customer's data , we also create a hidden field ca lled id2edit.  This then gets 
passed to the store_record component.  If we didn't include this hidden field, then the store_record part of the program would know a customer name, address, phone, email and 
title, because these were part of the form, bu t it wouldn't know which database id number 
they related to and thus wouldn't  be able to update the table. 
Deleting Data 
 Just one more database function to cover. We can now read, search, insert and edit data in 
MySQL tables.  All that remains is to be able to delete records.  This is very simple, using a 
DELETE FROM  query.  For example: 
 
delete from customers where id=8 
 
or  
delete from customers where surname="Smith" or firstname="James" 
 
Mostly you'll use the id-based version, in order to ensure that you're definitely deleting the 
correct record. 
 
Incidentally, be very careful when using DELETE FROM , to ensure that you always specify a 
WHERE clause.  For example, if you forget to do so, and you try:

delete from customers 
 
you'll find that every customer in your table wi ll be deleted  And no, there's no undo facility 
i n  M y S Q L .   Y o u ' l l  h a v e  t o  r e v e r t  t o  t h e  b a c k u p  w h i c h  y o u  m a d e  v i a  t h e  e x p o r t  f a c i l i t y  i n  
phpMyAdmin.  What?  You mean you aren't in the habit of backing up your MySQL tables 
regularly?  Maybe you need to consider doing so. 
 
There is little to be gained by  including a complete example application to delete a customer 
from our table.  It would be almost identical to the editcust.php example.  Just use a form 
a n d  s o m e  r a d i o  b u t t o n s  t o  a l l o w  t h e  u s e r  t o  p i c k  t h e  i d  o f  t h e  r e c o r d  t h e y  w a n t  t o  d e l e t e .   
Then, next time around, retrieve that id and do: 
 
$id2delete = $_POST["id2delete"]; 
$query="delete from customers where id=$id2delete"; 
$q = mysql_query($query); echo "Record number " . $id2delete . " has been deleted."; 
 
A reminder.  During this chapter and the program listings within it, we've used $_GET and 
$_POST  to retrieve information.  Remember the difference.  To retrieve information that was 
passed as part of the URL, use $_GET.  To retrieve information that was passed as a form 
field (textbox, textarea or a hidden field), use $_POST.  Just as importantly, remember that 
any information that you don't explicitly pass eith er on the URL or in a form field will not be 
present. 
Putting it All Together 
 
So there you have it.  You now know about data bases, PHP, and how to put the two together.  
You have all the building blocks necessary to design and create a complete PHP/MySQL 
application that has the ability to allow users to  create, edit, search and delete information.  
Whether your application uses one table or one hundred, the processes are all the same, once 
you understand the concepts. 
 
The idea of using action= on the URL to allow one PHP file to contain an entire application 
is a good one, and one that I use all the time.  For example, you could create the entire Hotel 
Management System in a single hms.php file.  At the start, if $action is blank, you display the 
main menu (add customer, edit customer, and so on).  If the user chooses "add customer", 
then the action of th e menu form might be hms.php?action=add_customer .  This would 
display the data entry form, and this form might have an action of 
hms.php?action=add_customer_store .  Next time through the program, if $action is 
equal to add_customer_store , you know that the add_customer form was filled in by the 
visitor and your next step is to  retrieve the contents of the form and store it in the database.

Of course, if you prefer, you can split your application into lots of separate files.  You might 
have an hms.php file which does nothing more  than display the main HMS menu. Then, if 
the visitor chooses to add a new customer, you use a form or a simple hyperlink to go to 
hms_addcust.php instead. 
 How you choose to arrange things is entirely up to you.  Personally, I like to keep an entire 
application in a single file because it's easier to  find what you're lookin g for during an editing 
session.   But if you like keepin g each discrete part of an application separate, then feel free 
to do so.  This is especially us eful, of course, if you're working on a project with someone else. 
 
Having covered all the main points of developi ng a web database application, the remainder 
of this book looks at improving your general web knowledge and turning a site from a hobby 
computing project to a viable business idea.

Debugging and Global Variables 
 
Professional PHP programmers don’t use a simple  text editor like PSPad to develop their 
code.  Instead they inst all what’s known as an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, 
on their PC.  This includes PHP, a web server, and a sophisticated debugger to help in solving 
problems.    
There are various PHP IDEs on the market, some of which are very reasonably priced and 
some of which are most definitely not.  Howeve r, they are best avoided by all but the most 
serious PHP developers, because they’re large, co mplex, and require you to install things on 
your PC (specifically PHP and a web server) which pose a serious risk to stability and 
security unless you know what you’re doing. Af ter all, with a web server on your computer, 
anyone who knows its IP address could connect to  your PC and browse your files if you don't 
configure it correctly.  All of which leaves us with one problem.  If all you have is a copy of PSPad and access to a 
web server over the internet, how do you track down those elusive errors in your programs 
without the aid of a proper debugger? Hopefull y, the remainder of this chapter will help. 
 
There are two main types of error that you’ll enco unter.  The first is a syntax error, where the 
code you write isn’t valid PHP.  For example: 
 
echo "Sorry, room " . $room[1] . " is occupied" 
 
You'll spend ages looking for the missing quote, or dot, only to realise that the problem is 
actually a missing semi-colon on the end of the line. 
 The other type of problem is where your PHP code is valid, but doesn't produce the results 
t h a t  y o u  w e r e  e x p e c t i n g .   F o r example, having added a semicolon to the above line, it 
produces: 
 
Sorry, room  is occupied 
 
The mistake is clearly yours rather than the server's.  It's a coding error. The $room[1] 
variable is empty and you need to find out why. 
Syntax Errors 
 A syntax error in a PHP file will normally prevent the entire program from running, even if 
the error is towards the end of the file.  In mo st cases, you'll receive an error message from 
the server which will help you identify the cause of the problem.  For example:

This should be enough to help you track down the problem.  However, some server operators 
regard it as a security risk to display syntax errors, because they could provider hackers with 
clues as to the inner workings of a program (s uch as the names of vari ables or the locations 
of files). So they configure their server not to display syntax errors at all.  Which means that, 
if there's one in your PHP file, all you'll see is a blank screen.  The program won't run, but you won't be told why.  In such cases, your only realistic option is to find a different server.   
 It's important to note that, although server-gen erated syntax errors tell you the line number 
in you r code  tha t contains the  e rror,  this nu mb e r isn' t a l wa ys corre ct.   I t' s a  g rea t sta rting  
point when you're trying to track down the problem, but it's not infalli ble.  This is because 
PHP tends to assume that the error occurred on the line following the la st valid line.  Which 
isn't always the case.  This often means that the indicated line number will be "out" by 1 or 2, 
a l t h o u g h  i n  r a r e  c a s e s  ( e s p e c i a l l y  i f  y o u  h a v e  l o n g  b l o c k s  o f  b r a c k e t e d  c o d e  a n d  y o u ' v e  
omitted a bracket or added an extra one) it can be even more inaccurate.    
One useful technique, if you're stuck with a part icularly elusive syntax error, is "the chop".  
Split the PHP file into two separate files, of ro ughly even lengths.  So long as you don't break 
up any blocks of bracketed code, ie so long as  the opening or closing bracket doesn't end up 
in the other file, you should be safe.  The pr ograms won't work the way you expect, but that 
doesn't matter.  What matters is that one of them will generate a syntax error when you surf 
to it, and one won't.  You now know for sure which half of the file contains the error.  So split 
that file into 2 and repeat the process.  Even tually, the "half" which contains the syntax error 
will be small enough that you should be able to recognise where the problem lies. 
Coding Errors 
 
Whe n it com e s to tra cking  down coding  errors, your best friend a simple echo statement, 
possibly followed by exit().  For example, in the case mentioned above, precede the line 
with: 
 
echo $room[1]; 
exit();

When your program reaches this point, it will di splay the value of the variable and then stop.  
Of course, the fact that the variable is blank means that you won't see anything, so you might 
prefer: 
 
echo "XYZ" . $room[1] ; 
exit(); 
 
You can now look on the generated web page for XYZ, and you'll know where to expect to see 
the room number displayed alongside. 
 
And one final addition, which will also help.  Change the code to: 
 
echo "XYZ" . $room[1];  #debug 
exit();                 #debug 
 
This way, once the program is working properly, you can easily search for the lines with the 
comment in order to remove them.  If all this effort doesn't bring the bug out of the woodwork, then move your debug code 
further up the file, to just after the place wher e $room[1] is initially de fined.  Hopefully, its 
value at that point should be correct.  So somewhere between those two points it's being 
changed.  All that remains is to position your debug code, in turn, just after every line that 
changes (or which you suspect might change) the value of $room[1].  Chances are, the 
problem will be down to a simple  mis-spelling, eg rooms rather than room, or "1" rather than 
1. 
 
If you want to output the values of an entire array rather than a single variable, you don't 
h a v e  t o  w r i t e  a  f o r …  l o o p  t o  d o  i t .   P H P  h a s  s u c h  a  f e a t u r e  b u i l t  i n .   A s s u m i n g  t h e r e ' s  a  
problem with one or more elements of the $rooms array, and you want to see the whole array 
rather than just element 1, use var_dump.  The following code:  
<?php 
$rooms[1] = "ABC"; $rooms[2] = "DEF"; 
$rooms[3] = "GHI"; 
 echo "<pre>"; 
var_dump($rooms); 
echo "</pre>"; ?> 
 
Produces the following output:

This tells you that the array has 3 elements.  Element [1] is a 3-le tter string comprising ABC.  
Element 2 is a 3-letter string of DEF, and so on. 
 
If this still doesn't help, you can go one step further and output the contents of every variable that the program knows about.  Just do this: 
 
echo "<pre>"; 
var_dump(get_defined_vars()); 
echo "</pre>"; 
 
This works because there's a PHP function wh ich creates an array containing all of the 
variables.  So we call this function, then use var_dump  to display the array. As for the other 
two lines, the <pre> tag tells the web browser th at it’s being asked to display preformatted 
text, and is often used when disp laying program listings and the like.  Just trust me that the 
output of var_dump looks much more readable if surroun ded by such tags. 
 While this also produces the list of the contents  of the rooms array, it comes at the end of a 
very long (many hundreds of lines) listing of lo ts of other variables as well.  These are not 
variables that your program has created, but ones which the web server and PHP use for their own internal purposes.   Some of these are very useful.  For example, take a look at this 
extract from the list that is returned on the the-web-book.com server:

This section, as you can see from the top line, is concerned with the contents of the $_SERVER[] array, which contains 31 elem ents.  The element called “REQUEST_URI” 
(remember that element names don’t have to be numeric) , right down at the bottom of the 
list here, seems to contain the name of our prog ram file.  Let’s just check this, by writing a 
program thus: 
 
<?php 
echo $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]; 
?> 
 
And here’s the result:

This is hugely useful, for reasons we ’ll come onto in the next chapter.

That's a lot better.  Although this data may be usef ul to you, be aware that it’s server-specific.  
Some servers don’t include as much informatio n.  Some include a lot more.  Some don’t 
actually provide anything at all in $_SERVER,  c i t i n g  s e c u r i t y  r e a s o n s .   S o  u s e  w h a t ’ s  
available on your server, while remembering that  it m a y cha nge  if you  m ove  to a  diffe re nt  
one.  
One particularly interest ing server variable is  $_SERVER[“HTTP_REFERER”] , which lists 
the URL that the visitor to your site came from.  So if, for example,  your visitor was at 
www.site1.com/example.html  and clicked on a link to your PHP program, 
$_SERVER[“HTTP_REFERER”]  would be www.site1.com/example.html .  However, 
not all web servers pass on this information, so you can’t always rely on it being set.  In 
which case, you could do something like: 
 
<?php 
if (isset($_SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"]) 
{ 
echo "You came from " . $_SERVER[“HTTP_REFERER”]; 
} ?> 
 
Note the isset() function, which tells you whether a vari able exists or not (ie, whether or 
not it is set).   
 
You will see that there are no less than 3 server variables in the above list whose value is test99.php, ie the name of the PHP program file.  These are REQUEST_URI, 
SCRIPT_NAME and PHP_SELF.  We’ll use one of these in a moment.

Application Structure Revisited 
 
Imagine, if you will, a shopkeeper  in a small store which sells a variety of grocery items.  This 
i s  n o  s e l f - s e r v i c e  e m p o r i u m .   E v e r y t h i n g  i s  b e h i n d  t h e  c o u n t e r ,  s o  y o u  n e e d  t o  a s k  f o r  a n  
item, wait for the shopkeeper to hand it to you, then place it in your basket. 
 But this shopkeeper, though extremely fast an d polite, has a flaw.  He has no memory for 
names or faces.  As far as he's concerned, if you ask for a can of tuna and then a loaf of bread, he won't remember that the person who wants the bread is the same person who wanted the tuna a few seconds ago. He does, though, have a secret weapon.  He has a notepad, and he's 
very good at writing notes to help him remember what's going on around him.  
The shop, too, has a flaw.  There are a series of  high sound-proof barriers at the counter, like 
the starting stalls on a racecourse.  The customer has no idea, when queuing at the counter, 
whether any of the other stalls are occupied or whether he/she is the only patron in the shop. 
 
To help with preparing the accounts at the en d of the month, the shopkeeper records every 
transaction in his notebook.  The writes down  the item sold, the date and time, and which 
stall he handed the item to. 
 
Alice, Bob and Charles are in the shop.  Alice asks for some bread, which the shopkeeper duly hands over.  Bob then asks for some bread, and gets it.  Then Charles asks for some cheese.  
Then Alice wants bacon.  Then Charles wants bacon too. Then Alice wants apples. 
 Alice then leaves.  David arrives, and happens to end up in the stall previously occupied by 
Alice.  He buys potatoes and red wine. 
 As far as Alice is concerned, she asked for, and got, bread, bacon and apples.  She is 
convinced that she was the only person in the shop.  The shopkeeper was serving her, and no 
one else. 
 
As far as Bob is concerned, he too was the only person in the shop.  He asked for bread, and 
received it.  Charles, too, asked for cheese and bacon and was duly served.  And David got his 
potatoes and red wine. 
 
The shopkeeper, of course, has no idea who he  s e r v e d .   E a c h  t i m e  s o m e o n e  a s k e d  f o r  a n  
item, he retrieved it from the shelf and handed it over.  Though he did keep a record in his 
notebook, so he knows what was handed over, in what order, and which of the “stalls” he handed it to.  One particular stall, for exampl e, got bread, bacon, apples, potatoes and red 
wine. As it happens, those 5 items went to 2 di fferent people but the log doesn't record this.

Web Servers and the Real World 
 
OK, you can open your eyes now.  We’re back in the real world. 
 The shop analogy describes exac tly how a web server works.  Requests for pages come in 
from all over the world and they are handled, one at a time, by the web server.  Maybe Alice wants to see the home page, so we send it down the line to her.  Then Bob wants to see the Contact Us page, so we send it.  Then Alice clicks on the “Our New Widget” link, from the 
h o m e  p a g e ,  s o  w e  s e n d  i t  t o  h e r .   T h e r e  i s  n o  l i n k a g e  b e t w e e n  A l i c e ’ s  t w o  p a g e  r e q u e s t s .   
First, she got the home page.  Then, some time  later, we sent her the page about the new 
widget.  In the mean time, 1, 2, 3 or a million  other people might have  requested pages.  All 
we have to tie everything together is the serv er’s log file, like the shopkeeper’s notepad, 
which tells us who asked for what, and in what order. 
 
Alice and David both used the same stall, but the log file doesn’t provide any way to record 
this.  All that the shop keeper knows is which stall a partic ular item was handed to, and not 
the name of the person in that stall at the time .  In the same way, two different users of a web 
server may use the same IP address, albeit not at the same time.  This lack of an ability to tie one user's chain of actions together is called statelessness.  In 
other words, a web page (or a request from a user's browser for the web server to send a 
page) is stateless.  It doesn't contain any information about the state of the connection 
between the user and the server.   
W h e n  t h e  se r v e r s i m p l y  c o n t a i ns  st a t i c  HT M L  p a g e s,  t h i s  i s n ’ t  a  p r o b l e m .   P e o p l e  s e nd  i n requests for pages, and we send them out as fa st as possible.  But with web-based, server-
side applications, things are different.   Here's a trivial example.   The receptionist at the hotel 
views the list of guests, and clicks to see the full details about guest number 64.  By clicking on the "View Full Info" button,  he/she launches another PHP program.  This program is 
quite capable of showing all the information about a guest, but doesn't know which one to show.  Sure, 64 was chosen in the previo us program, but that wasn't passed on. 
 
Here's another example.  Take the case of ou r hotel management system , and imagine a page 
that lets members of the public check availa bility.  Brian surfs to  the site, and enters 
"January 9
th" in a drop-down box on the availability checker form.  He clicks submit.  A PHP 
program receives his date, checks the database , discovers there's one spare room, and sends 
back a page saying "yes, we have a room on that  date".  Three seconds later, Janet fills in the 
form.  She, too, is looking for somewhere to stay on the night of January the 9th.  Again, the 
PHP program checks the database and, what do  you know, there's one vacancy.  Janet and 
Brian both begin to fill in the booking form...

Welcome to the world of multi-user database applications. 
 
How do you solve the problem?  One way is for the system to reserve the room for Brian for, 
say, 15 minutes.  Until then, anyone else who tries to book that room will be told it's not 
available.  After 15 minutes, th e lock is released and it goes back into the p ool of available 
rooms, assuming Brian hasn't booked it.  
How do you do this in practice?  One way is to have a column in the rooms table called 
locked_until.  To lock a room, just look up the current timestamp, add 900 to it (900 
seconds is 15 minutes), and write that into th e locked_until field of the room that Brian's 
interested in.  When you come to search for availability, if there's anything in a room's 
locked_until field, assume the room is not available.  And every 5 minutes or so, run a 
database query that removes every locked_u ntil field which is less than the current 
timestamp.    This is just one of the concepts you need to appreciate when writing web-based applications 
using server-side languages such as PHP.  Something else that you need to consider is how to structure your app.  For example, do you keep a ll of the code in a single file, or do you use 
one single, larger file to contain your entire application? This is something we have already 
discussed. 
Saving State 
 Earlier in this chapter, we talked about the way that web servers are stateless.  When a server 
receives a request from a visitor to send out a page, the server has no idea who the user is, or 
what state their session is in.  Have they just a rrived at the site?  Or have they been browsing 
for a while?  Are they logged in, or are they an untrusted user? 
 
One way to solve this problem is to use a PHP fe ature called sessions.  This is an advanced 
topic, beyond the scope of this introductory b o o k .   I f  y o u  w a n t  t o  k n o w  m o r e ,  t y p e  " p h p  
sessions" into your favourite search engine.

How to Back Up your Web Site 
 
Like any other collection of computer-based files, you need to back up your web site.   Sure, most web hosting companies have their own back ups, but that's only to protect themselves 
against major disasters like the loss of an entire server and all of the customers' sites that it 
contained.  If you accidentally delete a key fi le from your site, or someone manages to hack 
one of your pages and replace its contents with porn, it's unlikely that your hosting company 
will be willing or able to help.  Many companies don't do backups properly, and web hosting 
companies are no exception.  So it's much better to back up your own site and be safe rather than sorry. Also, if you ever want to move your site to a different server, having a backup to 
upload to the new server makes the process relatively easy.  
 
At the very least, your web site will consist of  a collection of assorted files (mostly HTML and 
some images, probably) in a top-level folder called something like public_html.  There may 
also be some additional folders within that to p-level one too.  All of these folders (ie, the 
entire contents of public_html and everythi ng within it) will need to be backed up. 
 
Unless you know for sure that you need to, it's unlikely that you'll need to back up anything 
that's outside of public_html.  Generally speaking, these files are there to help the server 
rather than you, and contain non-essential things  such as logs.  So for backup purposes they 
can be ignored.  One example of where data outside of public_html does need to be backed 
up, though, is if your host insists on .htaccess fi les being placed in a specific folder outside of 
the public_html one.  This is indeed the case  with hostmonster.com, as discussed on page 
114. 
 
Backing up a web site is simply a case of downlo ading the files to a local PC for safekeeping.  
To download the files you can use any FTP prog ram, including FileZilla.  Just connect to 
your site, navigate to a suitable empty folder on your local computer.  Then find the remote folder on the server (eg, public_html), righ t-click it, and choose Download.  The files will 
begin downloading.  Once it's finished, either keep the files on your PC, or perhaps archive 
them to a CD, DVD, USB pen drive or external  drive for safekeeping. Now, if anything 
happens to the contents of your web server, you have a safe copy. 
 
You don't have to back up the entire site at once, of course.  If you just want to download a 
single file, the same rule applies.  In FileZilla , right-click the filename on the remote server 
and choose the Download option. 
Don't Forget the Data 
 
Having backed up the HTML and image files from  your site, you also need to back up your 
MySQL databases.  Obviously this won't be relevant if you don't use a database.  But if you

do, failing to back up the database as well as the contents of public_html means that much of 
the content of your site has not been backed  up.  Thankfully, backing up is easy with 
phpMyAdmin, which is a tool we  first encountered on page 190 for creating database tables 
and inserting information into them. 
 
To back up a database, start phpMyAdmin by su rfing to its URL, or via the control panel on 
your web host.  Select your database from the li st on the left hand side, and click on Export 
from the menu items along the top.  You'll then see something like this: 
 
 
 In the "Export" box, choose which tables in the database you want to back up.  Assuming 
you'll be wanting to restore the backup onto a web server and into a MySQL database in the 
future, leave the export format set to SQL.  But you may wish to explore the other options, s u c h  a s  C S V  o r  E x c e l ,  i f  y o u  w a n t  t o  e x p o r t  t h e  M y S Q L  d a t a b a s e  t a b l e s  i n t o  a  t e x t  o r

spreadsheet format.  This can be useful if, for example, you have been running an online 
survey which saves its data into a database and you then want to extract the information into 
a spreadsheet to analyze offline.  
All that remains is to tick the "save as file" bo x, type a name into the filename template area, 
and phpMyAdmin will start the backup. 
 
The backup itself will consist of a text file, do wnloaded to your PC, wh ich contains a program 
script.  By uploading this script to phpMyAdmin in the future, it will restore the contents of 
the backup into the database tables. 
 
Note that most hosting companies place a limit on the size of a backup script that you can 
upload in order to restore.  Check yours by clicking on the Import link and looking for any 
hint.  Here's the screen from hostmonster.com's version of phpMyAdmin which, as you can 
see, has a limit of 51,200 KiB, which is around 50 megabytes.    
 
 Therefore, if you find that backing up all of th e tables of a database re sults in a script file 
larger than 50 MB, re-do the back up in multiple parts, a few tables at a time, ensuring that 
each script is less than 50 MB.   
Restoring Lost Information 
 
Hopefully you'll never lose information from your  site and so you won't ever need to restore 
from a backup.  If you do, though, it’s not particularly difficult. 
 
In the case of static files, such as HTML file s and images, just use Fi leZilla to re-upload the 
files to your site. 
 
To restore a MySQL database that was backed  up with phpMyAdmin, start phpMyAdmin, go 
to the database you want to restore, then clic k the Import link on the top menu line.  Choose 
the script file to upload (this needs to be one that was created by phpMyAdmin's export 
feature) and your database is restored.

If you've never tried backing up and restoring a MySQL database table, now might be a good 
time to make sure that you know how to do it.  Use phpMyAdmin to create a test table, insert 
a couple of rows, then back up the table and de lete it.  Now try restoring the table from the 
backup and check that it reappears.

Promoting and Profiting 
 
As you begin to create Web-based applications, your attention will probably turn at some point to wondering whether you can make money from your sites.  After all, Facebook and 
Twitter are just web-based applications, as indeed  is Google.  If your site could make just a 
thousandth of the revenue that those sy stems make, life would be wonderful. 
 
If you're serious about this side of things, I strongly recommend that  you also pick up a 
b u sine ss te xtb ook as wel l  as this te chnica l  on e.  Making money from web sites is as much 
about knowing about marketing as being able to  write programs.  But for now, I'll assume 
you simply want an overview of the ways that  you can promote your site and make money 
from it. 
 
This chapter covers two main topics, which ar e closely linked.  First, spending money to 
advertise your site online.  Second, making mo ney from your site, by hosting other people's 
advertising. 
Promoting Your Site 
 
One of the most costly mistakes that web site developers make is  to assume that, if you build 
a site, the visitors will come in th eir droves.  Frankly, they won't.   However good your site is, 
your weekly total of visitors will be close to zero unless yo u can promote it. Attracting a 
he a l thy num be r of visitors is difficu l t.   Kee ping  them  coming  ba ck to you r site ,  we e k a fte r 
week, is even harder.  After all, think of how many hundreds or thousands of web sites you've 
visited in the past.  How many of them  do you visit at least once a week? 
 Attracting visitors to your site (or, as the professionals call it, driving traffic to your site) can 
be done in many ways.  The cheapest option is to simply plug away, relentlessly mentioning 
i t  i n  a s  m a n y  o n l i n e  f o r u m s  a n d  m e s s a g e  b o a r d s  a s  y o u  c a n  f i n d .   B u t  d o  i t  t o o  o f t e n ,  o r  
mention it in places that aren't relevant, and yo u'll rapidly gain a reputation as a spammer.   
 
The other end of the scale, if you have a large marketing budget, is to advertise the site on 
radio, TV, and in newspapers and magazines.   However, regardless of the cost, advertising a 
web site is relatively ineffective for one simple reason: most people aren't near their 
computer at the time they see or hear your ad .  And by the time they get to the PC, they'll 
have forgotten to visit your site or they'll have forgotten your URL.  Therefore, by far the best way to attract visito r s  t o  a  w e b  s i t e  i s  t h r o u g h  o n l i n e  p r e s e n c e ,  
where the customer can instantly click through to your site.  It pays to spend some time 
reading the various documentation that Google  makes available to webmasters, to ensure 
that your site is as far up the search result s pages as you can possibly make it.  Also, spend

some time researching the sort of news sites th at your ideal visitors might read, and, where 
relevant, send a press release to the site.  
 Don't underestimate just how much of a difference it makes to have your web site mentioned 
somewhere online, where people can click straight through, rather than in print.  To quote 
one fairly unscientific example, when I wrote an article for a UK-based national newspaper, 
the mention of my website in print generate d a few hundred hits.  When I sent a press 
release about a new product to about 20 differe nt online news sites, it was published on 
about 5 of them and generated a quarter of a million hits. 
 
If you want to advertise your site online, and you have some money to do so, by far the most 
popular service is Adwords, from Google.  Sign up for the service via Google's web site, give 
them your credit card details, then pay some money into your Adwords account.  Then choose the search terms that you want to buy.  Fo r example, if your site is promoting the Star 
Inn Hotel in London, you'll probably want to choose terms such as "star inn hotel", "London 
hotel", "cheap London breaks", and so on.  The skill is to think of what the typical Googler 
might be searching for.    I f  y o u ' r e  h a p p y  w i t h  t h e  p r i c e  t h a t  G o o g l e  o f f e r s  y o u ,  c l i c k  a  b u t t o n  a n d  y o u r  a d v e r t i s i n g  
campaign is up and running. When someone searches for, say, a cheap London break, your 
ad will be shown on the right hand side of th e search results page in the Sponsored Links 
section.  It won't be shown every time, ne cessarily.  It depends on how many other 
companies have bought that search term, and wh ether they've elected to pay more than you. 
 Adwords is a "pay per click", or PPC, service.  Google will automatically display your ad on 
search results, but you only pay when someone ac tually clicks on the link to your sponsored 
site.  At which point your Adword account is  debited by a small amount.  You'll know the 
amount, because you'll have agreed to it when  you set up the campaign.  When your account 
balance is empty, Google stops displaying your  ads and emails you a reminder to add more 
credit.  
The Adwords management site is very sophistica ted.  You can log in and view details of how 
often your ads are being clicked on, and you can set daily limits so that, for example, your 
entire balance won't be used up on day one of a campaign.   
If you want to explore the use of Adwords, G oogle gives away million s of starter vouchers 
every month, entitling you to around £30 or $50 of free Adwords credit.  Just look for the 
vouchers in your favourite computer magazine .  Many Web hosts also give away similar 
promotions, so check on your web hosting control panel to see if yours does.  In the case of 
Hostmonster, here's the relevant  section of the control panel:

As you can see, there's $50 of free Adwords cred it available, as well as some credit for 
spending with Yahoo and Miva.  Considering that  all three are free, at least to try out, it 
makes sense to spend the free credit and see which,  if any, is worth sticking with as a way to 
help promote your site. However, note that the free Adwords credit offered by Hostmonster 
is only available to US-based customers. 
Making Money 
 
If you want to make money from your web site, there are really only two ways to do it.  One  
is to charge visitors a subscrip tion.  The other is to place adverts on your pages, and charge 
the advertisers for the privilege. 
 
I n  g e n e r a l ,  i t ’ s  d i f f i c u l t  t o  m a k e  m o n e y  f r o m  a subscription site.  Most people don’t like 
paying for access to a site, unless it’s for in formation or other content that they can’t get 
elsewhere for free.  And even then, they’d rather search the web for a pirated username and password.   Marketing subscriptions is expensiv e, and persuading existing customers to keep 
renewing every month/year is also difficult.  Therefore, unless you’re an experienced web 
marketer, charging a subscription fee is not recommended. 
 The other option, ie carrying ads on your site, ma kes more sense.  Especially if you can find a 
c o m p a n y  t h a t  w i l l  d o  a l l  t h e  h a r d  w o r k  f o r  y o u ,  t o  s a v e  y o u  h a v i n g  t o  s e l l  t h e  a d v e r t i s i n g  space and handle the payments yourself.   Thankfully, there are indeed such companies, and getting everything up and running is incredibly easy.  As you might expect, the leading player 
in this market is, once again, Google. 
 Google Adsense is a scheme whereby your site  c a r r i e s  a d v e r t s  t h a t  h a v e  b e e n  p l a c e d  b y  
Google’s Adwords advertisers.  So if, for exam ple, an advertiser has sponsored the search 
term “cheap hotel break”, and your web site contains information ab out holidays, then, in 
addition to the advertiser’s ads being shown on Google’s search results page, it will also be 
shown on your site.  And each time someone wh o visits your site clicks on one of your 
adverts, you make money.  
Adsense is well worth signing up fo r, even if only as a trial to se e if it’s worth your while.  But 
like any other internet-based business, you need to invest some time if you want to make the 
most of it.  This means continually tweaking th e layout of your site, and the content, and the 
position of the ads, in order to find out what works best for you.

To sign up for Adsense, and hopefully star t making money from your web site, go to 
www.google.com/adsense  (or the local version of Google in your country, if there is one).  
You’ll need to have a Google account to proceed , so sign up if you don’t already have one.  
You can then choose a design for the ads, such as from the examples shown here: 
 
 
 
You can also choose the colour scheme, font st yle, and whether the ad s have rounded corners 
or not.   You can even specify the names of your main business competitors to ensure that 
ads for those companies won’t be displayed on your pages.  
Once you’ve specified the ad format, Google wi ll display a few lines of HTML code.  All you 
need to do is copy it, and paste it into your web pages at the point where you want the ads to 
appear.  That’s all there is to it.  The HTML code contains a pointer to your unique Google 
Adsense account, so your account will automatica lly be credited whenever someone clicks on 
an ad.  All that remains is to log into Adsense every few days and check how much you’ve 
earned, and then tell Google how you’d like to receive your payment. 
 
Incidentally, don't be tempted to click on the ad s yourself, or persuade friends to do so, in 
order to make a quick buck.  It won't work.  Google will quickly notice what you're doing, and 
close your account.

Accepting Online Payments 
 
Have you ever wondered how sites like Amazon an d eBay allow you to buy things online with 
your credit card automatically?  Would you like to have your web site offer the same facility, 
so that people can pay for your products or services online and the money automatically ends 
up in your account?  If so, read on. 
 I f  y o u ' r e  l o o k i n g  t o  s e t  u p  a n  o n l i n e  s h o p ,  to sell either physical goods or downloadable 
items, there are various ways to do it.  The simp lest is to find out whether your web hosting 
company and/or your ISP already offer such facilities.  Here's the relevant part of the control panel from one web hosting compan y, for example.  For as little as £8.99 a month, or around 
$15, you can have an online shop with 150 items.   It just takes a few clicks, and is by far the 
easiest way to proceed, short of simply selling on eBay instead.

If you want to set up your own online shop, ho wever, and do things yo urself, you'll need to 
learn about two new bits of technology. 
 
First, you'll probably want to find a program that can automatically manage your catalogue 
of items, pictures and prices, and turn it into a neat collection of browsable web pages to 
publish on your site.  You don't have to do it this way, of course.  You could create the pages 
yourself, but adding new products or  categories can be complicated. 
 
If you don't have a budget, check out a free package called osCommerce at 
www.oscommerce.com .  If you would rather pay for a commercial product, one major 
player is Actinic Catalog (see www.actinic.com ). 
 
The second technology is how to actually handle  the payments.  The theory is simple.  Sign 
up for an account with a payment handler such  as Paypal and/or Google Checkout.  Then 
add some PHP programming to your site so that visitors can pay for your goods electronically. 
 
Shopping cart software such as osCommerce and Actinic Catalog have payment integration 
built in.  So long as you have an account wi th one of the supported payment companies, and 
your product database contains a unique id number and a price for each item, the software 
will do the rest.  But if you'd rather write your own integratio n code, it's not particularly 
difficult.  Every payment handler publishes an integration manual, whic h contains complete 
instructions and some sample code.    
In the case of Paypal, the process is relatively simple.  You create (or buy some software that 
does it for you) an HTML form that allows the visitor to specify which item they want to buy 
from you.  The form fields specify the item id and the price.  There are also some additional 
hidden fields that contain your account number  and an order id.  You configure the form's 
"action" property so that its contents get sent to Paypal, rather than your own site, when the 
visitor clicks the "Submit" (or probably the "Buy Now") button.  Paypal then takes over, asks 
the user for the credit card details etc, and credits your account.  It then sends back a 
confirmation message to your si te by calling your URL, eg: 
 
www.yoursite.com/paypal?confirm=yes&order_id=12345  
 
Your PHP code then retrieves the order_id fr om the URL, and therefore knows which order 
has been successfully processed (or not).  You can then update your own records accordingly, such as by adding a record to your customer da tabase to indicate that this customer has paid 
for their goods.

Needless to say, the process is slightly more invo lved than this, partly in order to ensure that 
it's secure, but the procedure is very much as described.   
 If you want to make things even easier, you do n't have to go down the route of full payment 
integration.  For example, on the 
www.the-web-book.com  site is a button that allows you to 
make a donation for the book by Paypal.  This took just a few minutes to set up, including me signing up for a Paypal merchant account.  The lack of proper integration means that I don't 
have an online MySQL database containing precise details of who has paid, but I can get basic information by logging into my Paypal accoun t so it's not a problem.  If you want to see 
online, check out Paypal (and Goog le Checkout, which is similar) first.  It may save you a lot 
of time. 
Managing your Marketing 
 Whatever you're selling online, and however you' re trying to make money from your site, you 
n e e d  t o  b e  a b l e  t o  m a n a g e  y o u r  m a r k e t i n g  e f f o r t  i n  o r d e r  t o  k n o w  w h e t h e r  i t ' s  a c t u a l l y  working.  It's not unknown for large orga nisations to spend tens of thousands of 
pounds/dollars per month advertising their business on Google Adwords.  With that sort of 
money at risk, or even if you're just spending  a tiny proportion of that, you need to know 
whether your money is being well spent.  Equa lly, if you're trying your hand with a DIY 
approach, and sending out press releases, you ne ed to know whether or not you're wasting 
your time. 
 
At the most basic level, you can find this out by looking at the raw hit counts on your site.  
Most web hosting companies offer some form of hit counter, so you can always see at a glance how busy your site has been.  In the ca se of Hostmonster, here's the relevant section 
of the control panel: 
 
 
 
 The Bandwidth option shows how much inform ation has left your site.  For example:

Webalizer and Awstats show graphics which indi cate how busy your site has been.  You can 
view the number of page hits for any given hour , day, month or year.  Be aware that not all 
hosts offer the same programs, and in some case s you need to enable the logging otherwise it 
won't be available.  This is the case with Ho stmonster – if you don't click on the Choose Log 
Programs option and enable Awstats and Webalizer, you won't get any data to analyze. 
 
Here are some of the graphs and reports that Webalizer can show.  These are taken from the 
site for this book which, as you can see, was pretty popular during Au gust 2009.  The reason 
for the traffic peaks around 6am is that, at the time, the book was mostly being promoted on 
an Australian web site and yet the server is based in the USA.

With the graphs from systems like Webalizer at yo ur fingertips, it's easy to see whether your 
advertising is working.  For example, try canc elling your Adwords campaign for a few days, 
then start it again and see if there's a noticeab le increase in traffic.  Also, log into your 
Adwords account on Google and look at your clic k rates, ie the number (or percentage) of ads 
displayed on your site which people actually  click on.  Then perhaps try tweaking or 
rearranging the site layout slightly and see if the numbers improve.  
If you want even more stats and data from yo ur site, consider signing up to an analytics 
service.  Google Analytics lets you tracks visito rs as they progress through your site, in order 
to build up a picture of how they use it.  For example, if you have a site consisting of a home 
page, a product catalogue and an order form, G oogle Analytics will tell you what percentage 
of the visitors who browse your  catalogue subsequently abandon their shopping cart rather 
than paying for its contents.  Google Analytics is free to use.  Just sign up for an account, and they'l l give you a couple of 
lines of HTML code that you need to include in the header section of every page on your site.

Search Engine Optimisation 
 
Having built a web site, whether from static HTML pages or as a PHP/MySQL application, 
your job is not finished.  You now need to attract visitors to it. 
 
Most people locate web sites of interest by usin g a search engine such as Google.  Therefore, 
by far the easiest and cheapest way to attract visi tors is to ensure that your site, rather than 
anyone else’s, is top of Google’s list.  
Sadly, if you’re hoping that this chapter will te ll you how to achieve this , you’re in for a major 
disappointment.  For obvious reasons, search  engine companies don’t divulge the precise 
details of the formulas that they use when deciding whether one site should be higher in the l i s t  t h a n  a n o t h e r .   H o w e v e r ,  t h e y  d o  p u b l i s h  a  s e l e c t i o n  o f  t i p s  w h i c h  c a n  h e l p .   T h e s e ,  combined with anecdotal evidence from people who run sites that do achieve a good Google 
ranking, are clearly worth following. 
 The art (actually it’s more like a science) of getting good search results is known as search 
engine optimization, or SEO.  If you want to know more about it, search online, or in your favourite bookshop or library.  
If, during your quest, you encounter advert s for companies or software products which 
guarantee your site a top-10 placing in return for a fee, avoid.  As previously mentioned, 
search engines keep their methods highly secr e t ,  s o  a n y o n e  w h o  c l a i m s  t o  k n o w  h o w  t o  
defeat them is, at best, mistaken.  Don’t waste your money. Instead, follow the advice below. 
SEO Tips 
 
You can follow these tips to help ensure that your site gets a good search engine placement. 
Results are not guaranteed, but what follows is based on official advice from Google as well 
as anecdotal evidence from friends of  mine who run high-ranking sites. 
 
• Search engines work by automatically sc anning, or crawling, the web and adding 
every word of every page to their enormous indexes.  They normally manage to find 
new or changed sites automati cally on their regular (every week or 2) crawl.  
However, you can kick-start the process for a new site by manually telling the search 
engine to add it to its list of sites to crawl.   To do this, look for the “submit your site” 
link which every search engine site has.  You only need to enter the URL of the front 
page.  The search engine will then automatica lly follow all of the links within it to 
locate other pages.

• Search engines typically have between 10 an d 20 billion web pages in their index.  A 
database of this size takes a long time to build, so don’t be surprised if an amendment 
to your site doesn’t show up in Google for a few weeks.   
 
• Ensure that every page on your si te has a page title.   See page 53 for how to do this. 
 
• Make sure every page has a “description” and “keywords” meta-tag, as outlined on 
page 55. 
 
• Every page on the site should be reachable by at least one hyperlink, so that the search engine can follow the links in  order to find all your pages. 
 
• Be aware that search engines are very poor when it comes to indexing information that is held in MySQL databases and which doesn't exist as a static HTML page.  The 
reason for this should be obvious.  Google can’t access your MySQL database directly, but only through your website.  So if you have a page which says “Please enter a name 
to search for”, the only way for Google to extract every name from the database would 
be to electronically “type” every possible name in the world into that box.  So, in the case of database-driven sites, it’s especially important to also have a handful of “real” 
pages (ie, without a ? in the URL) that contain lots of relevant information about the 
site. 
 
• Google Sitemaps, often known as XML Site maps,  are a way of helping Google and 
other search engines find their way around a we b site in order to index it.  If you have 
a site where the majority of content is ge nerated dynamically from a database, rather 
than existing as static HTML files, it is  well worth investigating these.  Don't get 
confused with standard site maps, as ment ioned below, which consist of easy-to-read 
collections of links, which are designed to he lp human visitors navi gate your site.  An 
XML or Google Sitemap isn't as easy to read, at least not by humans. 
 
• Offer a site map to your visitors, with link s that point to the important parts of your 
site. Even if visitors don’t use it, search engines will.  If the site map is larger than 100 
or so links, you may want to break the site map into separate pages. 
 
• Don’t try to cheat.  Some people include keywords that don’t accurately reflect the 
content of their pages.  Or they use tricks such as white text on a white background to 
hide extra information within a page that Google will see but which is hidden from 
human visitors. When Google’s automatic systems detect this, your site will be 
removed from all of Google’s indexes and it’s very difficult to get reinstated. 
 
• Think about the words users would type to find your pages, and make sure that your 
site actually includes those words within it.

• Use text instead of images to display important names, content, or links. The Google 
crawler doesn't recognize text contained in images. If you must use images (such as a logo, or a picture of a chart or graph) for te xtual content, also use the "alt" attribute to 
include a few words of descriptive text. 
 
• Make sure there are no broken HTML links in your pages.  
 
• Ensure that all pages vali date correctly.  There's more about this on page 56. 
 
• Ensure that every page specifies a DOCTYPE.  There's more about this on page 60. 
 
• If you use a "keywords" meta-tag on a page, ensure that the page also mentions those 
keywords. Otherwise Google might assume th at you're trying to cheat, by listing 
keywords that are actually nothing to  do with the content of the page. 
 
• Ensure that HTML page filenames and imag e filenames are, where possible, relevant 
to the content of the site rather than just a meaningless name.  For example, in a site 
about a hotel, a page called vacant_room s.html which contains an image called 
sample_room.jpg is better than a file called vr01.html and an image called samp.jpg.   
 
• The more often you update your pages, th e higher they’ll be ranked by search 
engines.  Google doesn't favour out-of-date sites. 
 
• Use proper hierarchical HTML tags in your pages, regardless of whether you generate 
t h e  c o n t e n t  f r o m  a  d a t a b a s e  o r  y o u  u s e  s t a t i c  H T M L  f i l e s .   T h i s  i s  k n o w n  a s  u s i n g  
semantic markup, and you'll find out more by searching for the phrase in Google.  
Essentially, use the built-in h1, h2, h3 etc heading tags, correctly structured.  So start 
with an h1 tag at the top of the page, then one or more h2 tags, and perhaps also some 
h3 headings within the h2 ones.  Don't put,  s a y ,  a n  h 3  h e a d i n g  d i r e c t l y  w i t h i n  h 1  
section. This all helps the search engine  understand the structure of the page. 
 
• Google regards your page as especially important if there are lots of links to it from other sites. So encourage friends and busine ss partners to link from their site to 
yours, perhaps in exchange for a link from your site to theirs. 
Keeping the Crawlers Away 
 Most of the time, you want to encourage Google  and other search engines to crawl your site 
and add your content to their index.  But someti mes there will be areas of your site that you

would rather didn't get indexed.  For example, the folder or directory that holds unfinished 
pages that aren't for public consumption. 
 There's a way of telling search engines which fo lders to ignore, and it's done through the use 
of a robots.txt file.  This is a special text file that you need to place in the top-level folder of the publicly accessible part of your web site.  In the case of hostmonster, that means the 
public_html folder. A typical robots.txt file, whic h you can create with any text editor such as 
Wordpad or PSPad (but not a word proce ssor like Word), might look like this: 
 
User-agent: * 
Disallow /joomla/images 
Disallow /hms 
 
The first line is where you could, if you wanted , specify which search engines you wish to ban 
from your site.  Chances are, you'll want to block them all, which is what the line in the above 
example does.  Then, just list all the folders yo u want to block, using Disallow commands.  In 
this case, I'm blocking Joomla's images folder and our HMS system.  Note that there's no compulsion for search engi nes to obey the contents of a robots.txt file, 
but almost all of them do.  Regardless of whether you use a robots.txt file or not, don't use a web server as a way of 
storing or exchanging private information.  Th at's not what they're designed for.  Even 
though you don't include a link to your private f i l e  a r e a  f r o m  y o u r  p u b l i c  w e b  p a g e s ,  t h a t  
doesn't mean that Google won't already have fo und the files and indexed them for the rest of 
the world to find.  This happens a lot.  Try a Google search for "private and confidential" or 
"commercial in confidence" for some worrying examples. 
If at First you Don’t Succeed, Pay 
 
Each page of Google search results contains two sorts of information.  In the image below, 
where I've used Google to search for a "cheap camera", the results at the very top, as well as 
those down the right hand side, are discretely labelled as Sponsored Links and shaded in a 
very pale yellow.  I've made the yellow a little brighter, and highlighted the "sponsored links" text, to illustrate just how much of Google's results are not as independent and merit-based as you might think.

The End.  So, What Now? 
 
Congratulations.  That’s the end of this book , and you’ve managed to make it all the way 
through.   So where do you go from here?  Ho pefully you’ll have followed some or all of the 
examples, and you’ll have one or more web sites th at do much of what you set out to achieve.  
But a web developer’s work is never done, so there are probably more things that you’re 
aching to do.  
 
Sadly, this book can’t cover everything about the subject.  If you were to buy or borrow 
comprehensive books on everything we’ve covered here, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, 
PHP, MySQL and web page design, it’s likely th at your collection would run to 10,000 pages 
or more.   
 
This book is being expanded all th e time, however, so check back at www.the-web-
book.com  regularly to ensure that you’re always wo rking from the latest revision.   But if 
there’s more that you want to find out, then the web, and especially a search engine, should 
be your next stop.  Whether you need to know  about one specific PH P function, or general 
advice about how to make your CSS-based designs look better, everything you need to know 
is out there if you know how to search.  And be cause PHP is such a popu lar choice for writing 
software, there are hundreds of web sites and helpful forums devoted to it.  Whatever you 
want to do, chances are that someone's already done much of the hard work for you and is 
willing to share the code. 
 
In the future, I'm hoping to include some mo re advanced topics in The Web Book. These will 
include: 
 
Ajax and DHTML Database indexes 
A login and authentication framew ork for building secure sites 
MySQL table joins 
PHP Sessions 
Object-oriented PHP programming 
 
The web is indeed a wonderful place.  But you probably knew that already.  I guess that’s why 
you started reading this book.  I just hope you en joyed it, and that you’ll tell your friends and 
colleagues to download their own copy too.

Appendix A – Building a Test Server 
 
 
 
If you want to set up a test web server, and you already know the basics of things like FTP, 
php and mysql, this appendix will tell you how to do it.  However, unless you specifically 
need (or want) to do this, it’s perfectly acceptable to stick with the hosting space you’ve 
bought, both for hosting your live site and also for work in progress.  In which case you can 
safely ignore this appendix.  Building web servers is mostly for technophiles. 
 
 
For setting up a test web server, you’ll need  a spare computer from which you don’t mind 
deleting all data and programs.  It needs to be Windows-compatible, even though we won’t 
be running Windows on it.  It doesn’t need to be particularly new or powerful, though. 
 For a test web server, a server-oriented versio n of Linux is a good choice.  Why server-
oriented?  Because the added GUI desktop is  totally unnecessary.  Why not Windows?  
Because this book is all about doing things as cheaply as possible, and you probably don’t want to buy another copy of Windows for your test server.  
 
The only thing you need to check is that your computer has a built-in Ethernet connector on 
the motherboard. If its networking capability  comes via a USB or PCMCIA plug-in adaptor, 
chances are that it won't work without you getting involved in  some substantial fiddling.  
 I'm going to use Ubuntu Server 7.10 for this project.  It’s ideally suited to the task, and it (and 
all the other components we’ll be installing) is av ailable totally free of charge.  So if you fancy 
giving it a go, here’s what you need to do. 
Our Goal 
 
By the end of this chapter you’ll have a work ing Web server onto whic h users can safely and 
securely upload files via FTP. You’ll also  h a v e  W e b m i n  i n s t a l l e d ,  f o r  r e m o t e  a d m i n  
functionality, plus Webalizer for generating web usage stats. Pl us, you’ll be able to host 
PHP/MySQL sites too.  
Note that commands you need to type  are in a bold Courier typeface like this . 
 
Also, you are strongly advised to keep your ne w web server within the confines of your own 
LAN and use it purely for your own education and experimentation. Assuming your new server is connected to the internet via a broadband router, it won’t be accessible by the world

in general unless you change your firewall setting s in order to allow incoming connections on 
port 80. And frankly, that’s the way it should st ay. If you want to host real live web sites, 
open to the public, leave the hosting to the professionals. 
First Install the OS 
 
Get hold of a Ubuntu Server 7.10 CD, which you can download from 
http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/ub untu-7.10-server-i386.iso. Yes, I know that this isn't the 
very latest version, but it's perfectly acceptable for this project and it works well. If you really 
want to get the latest version of Ubuntu Server instead then feel free, but the instructions below might not work ex actly as you expect. 
 
To get started, boot the PC from the CD-ROM.  When asked, name your machine. I called 
mine webtest, but the precise name that you choose doesn't really matter. 
 
Your PC is probably connected to the internet via a broadband or cable router that handles 
DHCP, in which case the Ubuntu installer should  be able to make contact with the internet 
automatically and obtain from the router an IP ad dress for your server.  If it can't, you’ll be 
asked to enter an IP address, netmask and gateway address. If this works, then that's just fine.  
A word of advice. If Ubuntu can't detect a work ing network connection at all, that's probably 
because it doesn't have the necessary drivers av ailable for your computer's ethernet socket. 
In which case, to be brutally frank, you should probably give up at this point. You won't have 
messed up your PC with a half-installed copy of Linux yet, and trying to troubleshoot Ubuntu 
networking is not something for amateurs.  
Anyway, assuming that Ubuntu detected a network connection, you'll now be asked how to 
format the hard disk. Choose "guided – use entire disk".    
When asked, choose a name and password  for your day-to-day user account. 
 
From the software selection menu, select only  LAMP server. That's Linux, Apache, MySQL 
and PHP.  Next you’ll be asked for a mysql root password. Be aware that you’ll only be asked once (no 
confirmation required) and that the password yo u enter isn’t shown on screen. So make sure 
you know what you’re typing. 
 
That's the basic Linux installation over.  Remove the CD when prompted and the machine 
will restart. If you don’t see a login: prompt  after a minute or so, press Return and one

should appear. Remember that this is a server  installation so there's no pretty graphical 
interface here (and thus no need to  connect a mouse to this computer). 
 
At the login: prompt, log in with the user name and password you created earlier.  
 If the server acquired its own IP address using DHCP, you’ll need to know what address it was allocated.  Type ifconfig and have a look at what’s listed for inet addr . You’ll need to 
know this address in order to connect to th e machine, unless you register a domain name 
that points to it or you add an entry to your company’s internal DNS servers. If there's more 
than one entry under ifconfig, ma ke an intelligent guess as to which is the right one.  You 
may find, for example, that a non-existent wi-fi connection with an IP address of 127.0.0.1 is 
also shown.  
F r o m  n o w  o n  w e ' l l  a s s u m e  t h a t  y o u r  s e r v e r  is on 192.168.1.10.  Whenever you see this 
address mentioned below, substitute the correct address for your server. 
 
So far, we’ve only got one account set up. We also need to set a password for the root (ie, 
administrator) account for when we need to do things that require root access. So type sudo 
passwd root , specify your current password when asked, then choose a password for the 
root username. 
 Linux doesn’t normally allow you to log in as r oot directly so if/when you need to use your 
root privileges, log in with your normal user account and then type su, then enter the root 
password when prompted. In case you're wondering, it stands for super-user.  If you ever forget who you’re logged in as, the whoami command will tell you. Or look at the command 
prompt, which will end with $ for a no rmal user and # for a root user. 
Some Useful Commands 
 
Here are some useful commands to get you st arted, now that you’ve got a usable Linux 
system:  
shutdown –h now  turns off the computer. 
 
exit logs you out. You’ll need to do this twice if you used su. Remember that the web server 
is still running when you log out, so web/telnet  connections to it will still work just fine. 
There’s no need to remain logged in all the time. 
 
ls shows a directory listing (that's LS, not 1S). 
 
ls –la  shows a better one (that's LS -LA).

cd / switches to the root directory. 
 
cd dirname switches to the specified directory name, eg cd /etc. 
 
clear clears the screen, like cls does in Windows. 
 
cat is the linux version of the Windows "type" command if you want to display the contents 
of a text file. 
 
rm deletes a file 
 
cp is the linux equivalent of the DOS/Windows copy command. 
 
find / -name xyz.ext  will search the entire system  for a file named xyz.ext 
 
pwd (print working directory) tells you which directory you’re currently in 
 
Within an ls –la directory listing, lines that st art with a "d" are directories, otherwise they’re 
files. The other characters at the start of the line (such as rwxr--rw-) tell you who has permission to read, write, and execute the file.  A Google search for chmod will tell you how to understand and change these.  
Get Updated 
 Now we need to scan the internet for any impo rtant updates. The list of locations in which 
Ubuntu Server searches for updates is stored in a text file at /etc/apt/sources.list but the first 
entry in this file points to the Ubuntu Server  CD-ROM. We need to remove this entry from 
the list, otherwise we’ll keep getting prompted to insert the CD whenever we perform an update. 
 
This file is read-only, so you’ll need to be logged in as root (via su) to proceed beyond this point. In fact, everything that follows is best done as root (this is an exception rather than a 
rule - if you're not doing server ma intenance, never log in as root).  
 
Type cd /etc/apt 
Type vi sources.list  
 
You’ll now find yourself facing vi, undoubtedl y the worst editor ever invented. But without a 
GUI on your server you have little choice. Plus ,  i t ’ s  v e r y  h a n d y  t o  k n o w  t h e  b a s i c s  o f  v i  
because it's part of every Linux and unix system.

To move the cursor up, down, left and right, use the k, j, h and l keys (I told you it was bad).  
To delete the character under the cursor, press x .  T h a t  s h o u l d  b e  e n o u g h  t o  a l l o w  y o u  t o  
delete any line that makes reference to "deb cdrom" and which isn’t already commented out 
(ie, which doesn’t have a # at the start). 
 
If you mess up, type :q! and press return to abandon vi. If you manage to make it work, type 
:w to save the file and then :q to quit vi. 
 
You won’t have to use vi very often. Later on  we’ll install Webmin, which lets you maintain 
your server from another machine via a web browser. There’s a proper file manager and editor built into Webmin, thankfully.  
It’s now time to update the system so that you’re running the latest versions of everything. 
 
Type apt-get update  to update the catalogu e of possible updates. 
Then type apt-get upgrade  to download and install any that need installing. 
 
Note that apt-get may not work if your internet  connection goes via a proxy server. Even if 
you entered the name of a proxy server when you first set up the machine and configured it with an IP address, ap t-get doesn’t take any notice. To fix this, type: 
 
export http_proxy="http://yourproxy.com:80" 
 
specifying the address (and port) of your compan y’s proxy server. Then try the apt-get again.  
Test Your Web Server 
 You should now have a basic working web server , although we’re not finished yet. But you 
can test that everything is working by typing the server’s IP address into a web browser on 
another machine on your LAN. You should see a web page with a link to apache2-default, 
and clicking on the link will bring up a brief message.  Depending on your web browser, you 
may need to add http:// at the start of the address, eg type http://192.168.1.10 . 
 Next we’ll install a telnet server so that we can connect to the machine remotely over the LAN in command-prompt mode without the need to  actually be seated at the server itself. 
Install the Telnet Server 
 
Type apt-get install telnetd

This will download and install the telnet server. Now we need to kick-start it, by typing: 
 
/etc/init.d/openbsd-inetd restart 
 
You can now log out by typing exit (you need to type it twice because you used the su 
command, and the first time just takes you back into non-root mode).  
Everything we do from now on can be done remo tely via telnet so, if you want to install the 
server in a hard-to-reach cupboard, that’s no problem. You won’t need physical access to the 
server again unless something goes wrong or if you need to turn it back on after a shutdown 
command. 
 
To access your server type telnet 192.168.1.10 (or whatever the IP address of your 
server is) from any machine on your LAN and you’ll get a login prompt. You can do this from 
Windows or Linux or even a Mac. 
An FTP server 
 
Next, we need to install an FTP server so that people can upload HTML pages to your new 
web server. An ideal tool for this particular jo b is proFTPd (that’s Unix-speak for the Pro FTP 
Daemon). 
 
If you haven’t done so already, telnet to your server and type su to get root access. Or you 
can work on the server directly if it’s easier, of course. 
 
We need to take a little care to set up the FTP server in a reasonably secure manner, even though this is only for test or educational purposes. We need to make sure that a user who 
logs into the FTP server in order to upload web pages can’t browse the entire server but is 
locked into one directory. Also, a user who ha s an FTP username and password with which to 
upload web pages shouldn’t be able to use those credentials to access the system via telnet, as 
that would grant them far too much power.  
Type apt-get install proFTPd  to download and install the FTP server. You’ll be asked 
whether to choose an inetd installa tion or standalone. Choose inetd. 
 
The basic FTP server is now up and running, and yo u should be able to log into it with your 
non-root account, using any FTP client applicat ion. But we still need to set up an account 
that will allow someone to upload their web pa ges without also having access to any other 
parts of the system.

First, switch to the /etc directory by typing cd /etc. We need to edit the file called shells 
and add a new line that says /bin/false to the file. Then, when we set up a new user account 
for our web user, we’ll configure their account so that /bin/false is their command shell. 
Because there’s no such shell, they wo n’t be able to log in with telnet. 
 
Type vi shells  to edit the file. Use the cursor keys (h ,j,k,l) to move the cursor to the start 
of a new line, then press i to enter insert mo de. Press Return to insert a new line, and add 
/bin/false as a new line in the file. Press Esc to leave insert mode, save the file with :w then 
exit vi with :q and you’re done. 
 
Each user has a home directory which contains their various files. It’s like My Documents in 
Windows and normally it resides in the /home di rectory. For web users, rather than setting 
their home directory to be somewhere within /home we’ll put it under /var/www, which is 
the root of the web server.  Let’s make an account for a user called webuser1  with a password of flintstone.  These are the 
steps that you need to do for each web user account you want to create:  
cd /var/www 
mkdir webuser1 
useradd webuser1 –p xxxx –d /var/www/webuser1 –s /bin/false chown webuser1 webuser1 
passwd webuser1 and, when asked, choose flintstone as the password. 
 
Note that xxxx above is your root password, not the one that you want to assign for the 
webuser1 account.  
Also note the chown command which changes th e ownership of the webuser1 directory from 
root (which created it) to webuser1. If you don’ t do this, webuser1 won’t be able to upload 
files. 
 
Just to make sure that everything is working, verify that you can’t telnet to the server using 
the webuser1 account. FTP access should work, but telnet should not. 
 
Now create a simple index.html file and use FT P to upload it, using the webuser1/flintstone 
account.  Then surf to http://192.168.1.10/webuser1 from any machine on your LAN and you 
should see the uploaded page.

Type cd /etc/proFTPd  and then vi proFTPd.conf  t o  e d i t  t h e  c o n f i g  f i l e .  M o v e  t h e  
cursor up and down with j and k until you reach the DefaultRoot line, and remove the # 
symbol from the start of the line by pressing th e x key. This will lock all FTP users into their 
home directory (eg /var/www/webuser1) and won’t let them view files that are further up the 
tree. Without this step, our webuser account ho lders could use their FTP software to browse 
the entire server's directory structure. 
 
While you're in proFTPd.conf, add a new li ne near the top of the file which says: 
 
IdentLookups        off 
 
This will fix the problem which you’ll no doubt have noticed, of a few seconds’ delay when 
logging into the FTP server or uploading files. 
 
You may also wish to change the ServerName en try from Debian to the name of your server, 
to make the welcome message more relevant. With  vi, remember that typing i puts you into 
insert mode, for typing text, and Esc then pu ts you back into command mode from where 
you can type :w to save the file and :q to quit vi. 
Webmin 
 
Now that FTP is working, let’s install Webmin so  that we can remotely administer the server 
from anywhere on our LAN via a web browser. It ’s more fun and friendly than using telnet, 
and a great way to explore the machine. 
 
First, make sure you’re logged in as root (via your normal user account and su) then type the 
following, all on one line: 
 
apt-get install openssl libnet-ssleay-perl libauthen-pam-perl libio-
pty-perl libmd5-perl  
 
Then type (again, all on one line):  
wget 
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/webadmin/webmin_1.380_all.deb 
 
Note that wget probably won't work if your in ternet connection goes through a proxy server.  
In which case, type: 
 
export http_proxy="http://yourproxy.com:80"

first, and then issue the wget command. 
 
Finally type dpkg -i webmin_1.380_all.deb  and Webmin should be installed and 
ready to use. 
 
From another machine on your LAN, surf to https://192.168.1.10:10000 and log in as root, 
using your server’s root password. Note the ht tps bit – it won’t work with plain http. Also 
note the :10000, which is essential.   
Ignore the warning about a missing SSL securi ty certificate – you can trust this server 
unconditionally because it’s yours. You will, though, need Java installed on the PC from 
which you intend to use Webm in, otherwise it won’t work. 
 
Possibly the most useful part of Webmin is the file manager, which also lets you edit files. 
You’ll find it in the "others" category  at the bottom of the left-hand menu. 
Webalizer 
 
Now we’ll install Webalizer, which is a great tool  that produces graphical stats to show your 
web site usage. Even if you’re only using your server for test or educational purposes, it’s 
useful to be able to see the sort of stats that are available with such programs. 
 
To install webalizer type apt-get install webalizer  
 
You need to tweak the Webalizer config file before the program will work. Type cd 
/etc/webalizer  then vi webalizer.conf  and delete the .1 from the end of the LogFile 
entry. 
 
Webalizer produces its reports by analyzing the Ap ache web server log file on a regular basis.

this is via Webmin.

Choose to execute the job as root. The command to execute is /usr/bin/webalizer . Click 
on "Times And Dates Selected Be low". Under the minutes, tick "Selected" and choose 0, 15, 
30 and 45. For hours, days, months and weekdays, select "All".

HTML sites but also dynamic database-driven ones. PHP should already be working just fine, so we need to test that. Create a file called test.php which contains: 
 <? echo "this is a test file"; 
?> 
 
Upload it using the webuser1 account. Surf to http://192.168.1.10/webuser1/test.php and 
check that you see a web page containing just the message "this is a test file". If it works, PHP is working on your web server.  
To allow users to create databa se-driven sites we’ll install phpMyAdmin, which is a graphical 
web-based tool for managing MySQ L databases. It’s best if we don’t allow web users to create 
their own databases, but we do want them to be  able to manage the databases that we set up 
for them. PhpMyAdmin will work for both of th ese tasks. IE, for us to  create databases and 
for our web users to maintain the tabl es within their allocated database. 
 
As root, type apt-get install phpmyadmin 
 
When asked which web server you’re using, choose apache2. 
 
To use phpMyAdmin, surf to http://192.168.1 .10/phpmyadmin and log in with a username 
of root and the MySQL root pa ssword that you set up right at  the start of this chapter. 
 
On the front page of phpMyAdmin, scroll down to  the Privileges link and click it. Then click 
"Add A New User". Enter their username (webuser1 in this case), and assign them a 
password. This will be used for them to log into  phpmyadmin, and they’ll also use it in their 
PHP code in order to connect to their database (using a host name of localhost). It’s up to 
you whether you make it the same as their FTP password (flintstone). In this example, let’s 
set the password as barney.  Click "Create database with same name and grant all privileges" and all the hard work will be 
done for you. A database  called webuser1 will be created,  with permission for the webuser1 
account to do everything except creating new databases.

Log out of phpmyadmin (just close your browse r), and then log in again. This time, use a 
username of webuser1 and a password of barney. You should see only the webuser1 database 
and no others, and you should find that you ca n create tables on the database but you can’t 
create new databases.  You may also find that you can see a database called information_schema as well as your 
webuser1 database. However, this is harmless an d can be ignored – it’s not a security risk. 
 
And that's it.  You now have a fully working web server that you can use for test, 
development and training purposes.   
 As mentioned above, having your own web server for test purposes is fu n, but isn’t generally 
necessary.  The rest of this book assumes th at you have a hosting account somewhere, and 
that you’ll use this account to hold your web sites rather than putting them on your own test server.
